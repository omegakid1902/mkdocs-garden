Its main role is to regulate the amount of nutrients circulating in your bloodstream. Although insulin is mostly implicated in blood sugar management, it also affects fat and protein metabolism. When you eat a meal that contains carbs , the amount of blood sugar in your bloodstream increases. The cells in your pancreas sense this increase and release insulin into your blood. Insulin then travels around your bloodstream, telling your cells to pick up sugar from your blood. This process results in reduced blood sugar levels. Especially high blood sugar can have toxic effects, causing severe harm and potentially leading to death if untreated. However, cells sometimes stop responding to insulin correctly. This is called insulin resistance. Under this condition, your pancreas produces even more insulin to lower your blood sugar levels. This leads to high insulin levels in your blood, termed hyperinsulinemia. Over time, your cells may become increasingly resistant to insulin, resulting in a rise in both insulin and blood sugar levels. Eventually, your pancreas may become damaged, leading to decreased insulin production. After blood sugar levels exceed a certain threshold, you may be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes . Insulin resistance is the main cause of this common disease that affects about 9% of people worldwide ( 5 ). Resistance vs. sensitivity \u00b6 Insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity are two sides of the same coin. If you have insulin resistance, you have low insulin sensitivity . Conversely, if you are sensitive to insulin, you have low insulin resistance. While insulin resistance is harmful to your health, insulin sensitivity is beneficial. SUMMARY Insulin resistance occurs when your cells stop responding to the hormone insulin. This causes higher insulin and blood sugar levels, potentially leading to type 2 diabetes. Many factors contribute to insulin resistance. One is believed to be increased levels of fat in your blood. Visceral fat, the dangerous belly fat that accumulates around your organs, may release many free fatty acids into your blood, as well as inflammatory hormones that drive insulin resistance ( 16 , 18 ). Although this condition is more common among those with excess weight, people with low or normal weight are also susceptible ( 19 ). Other potential causes of insulin resistance include: Fructose. High fructose intake (from added sugar , not fruit) has been linked to insulin resistance in both rats and humans ( 20Trusted Source , 21Trusted Source , 22Trusted Source ). Inflammation. Increased oxidative stress and inflammation in your body may lead to this condition ( 23Trusted Source , 24Trusted Source ). Inactivity. Physical activity increases insulin sensitivity, while inactivity causes insulin resistance ( 25Trusted Source , 26Trusted Source ). Gut microbiota. Evidence suggests that a disruption in the bacterial environment in your gut can cause inflammation that exacerbates insulin resistance and other metabolic problems ( 27 ). What\u2019s more, various genetic and social factors may be contributors. Black, Hispanic, and Asian peoples are at particularly high risk ( 28 , 29 , 30 ). SUMMARY The main causes of insulin resistance may be overeating and increased body fat, especially in the belly area. Other factors include high sugar intake, inflammation, inactivity, and genetics. Your health practitioner can use several methods to determine if you\u2019re insulin resistant. For example, high fasting insulin levels are strong indicators of this condition. A fairly accurate test called HOMA-IR estimates insulin resistance from your blood sugar and insulin levels. There are also ways to measure blood sugar control more directly, such as an oral glucose-tolerance test \u2014 but this takes several hours. Your risk of insulin resistance increases greatly if you have excess weight or obesity, especially if you have large amounts of belly fat . A skin condition called acanthosis nigricans, which involves dark spots on your skin, can likewise indicate insulin resistance. Having low HDL (good) cholesterol levels and high blood triglycerides are two other markers strongly associated with this condition ( 3 ). SUMMARY High insulin and blood sugar levels are key symptoms of insulin resistance. Other symptoms include excess belly fat, high blood triglycerides, and low HDL (good) cholesterol levels. Insulin resistance is a hallmark of two very common conditions \u2014 metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Metabolic syndrome is a group of risk factors associated with type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and other problems. It\u2019s sometimes called insulin resistance syndrome, as it\u2019s closely linked to this condition ( 31 , 32 ). Its symptoms include high blood triglycerides, blood pressure, belly fat, and blood sugar, as well as low HDL (good) cholesterol levels ( 33 ). You may be able to prevent metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes by stopping the development of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is linked to metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, which are among the world\u2019s biggest health problems. Insulin resistance is strongly associated with heart disease, which is the leading cause of death across the globe ( 34 ). In fact, people with insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome have up to a 93% greater risk of heart disease ( 35 ). Insulin resistance is linked to various ailments, including heart disease, NAFLD, PCOS, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and cancer. It\u2019s fairly easy to reduce insulin resistance. Interestingly, you can often completely reverse this condition by changing your lifestyle in the following ways: Lose belly fat. It\u2019s key to target the fat that accumulates around your main organs via exercise and other methods. Reduce sugar intake. Try to reduce your intake of added sugars, especially from sugar-sweetened beverages . Eat well. Eat a diet based mostly on whole, unprocessed foods. Include nuts and fatty fish. Most of the habits on this list also happen to be associated with good health, a long life, and protection against disease. That said, it\u2019s best to consult your health practitioner about your options, as various medical treatments can be effective as well. Insulin resistance may be reduced or even reversed with simple lifestyle measures, such as exercise, healthy eating, and stress management. However, when carb intake is very low, such as on a ketogenic diet , your body may induce an insulin-resistant state to spare blood sugar for your brain. This is termed physiological insulin resistance and is not harmful ( 59 ). SUMMARY Low-carb diets reduce the harmful insulin resistance linked to metabolic disease, though they may induce a harmless type of insulin resistance that spares blood sugar for your brain. Insulin resistance may be one of the key drivers of many \u2014 if not most \u2014 of today\u2019s chronic diseases. Yet, you can improve this condition with simple lifestyle measures, such as losing fat , eating healthy food , and exercising. Preventing insulin resistance may be among the most powerful ways to live a longer, healthier life.","title":"Insulin and Insulin Resistance \u2014 The Ultimate Guide"},{"location":"%40%20healthline.com%2C%20Insulin%20and%20Insulin%20Resistance%20%E2%80%94%20The%20Ultimate%20Guide/#insulin-and-insulin-resistance-the-ultimate-guide","text":"Insulin is a hormone secreted by your pancreas.

A tape measure works, or you can simply look in the mirror and admire your progress. If you\u2019re running or biking or swimming to increase your endurance, you can track your progress by your heart rate, your breathing, and how long you can keep going until your muscles falter due to lactic acid buildup. But if your challenge is mental\u2014becoming proficient at calculus, say, or learning how to play a musical instrument or speak a new language\u2014it\u2019s different. There is no easy way to observe the resulting changes in your brain as it adapts to the increasing demands being placed on it. There is no soreness in your cortex the day after a particularly tough training session. You don\u2019t have to go out and buy new hats because the old ones are now too small. You don\u2019t develop a six-pack on your forehead. And because you can\u2019t see any changes in your brain, it\u2019s easy to assume that there really isn\u2019t much going on. That would be a mistake, however. There is a growing body of evidence that both the structure and the function of the brain change in response to various sorts of mental training, in much the same way as your muscles and cardiovascular system respond to physical training. With the help of such brain-imaging techniques as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), neuroscientists have begun to study how the brains of people with particular skills differ from the brains of people without those skills and to explore which sorts of training produce which types of changes. Although there is still a tremendous amount to learn in this area, we already know enough to have a clear idea of how purposeful practice and deliberate practice work to increase both our physical and mental capabilities and make it possible to do things that we never could before. Much of what we know about how the body adapts to training comes from studies of runners, weightlifters, and various other athletes. Interestingly enough, however, some of the best studies to date of how the brain changes in response to extended training were carried out not with musicians or chess players or mathematicians\u2014some of the more traditional subjects in studies of the effects of practice on performance\u2014but instead with taxi drivers. THE BRAINS OF LONDON CABBIES C\u00e1c t\u00e0i x\u1ebf taxi \u1edf London ph\u1ea3i tr\u1ea3i qua m\u1ed9t b\u00e0i test v\u1ec1 t\u1ea5t c\u1ea3 c\u00e1c tuy\u1ebfn \u0111\u01b0\u1eddng, c\u00e1c \u0111\u1ecba \u0111i\u1ec3m \u1edf London H\u1ed3i h\u1ea3i m\u00e3 c\u1ee7a nh\u1eefng t\u00e0i x\u1ebf taxi \u1edf London l\u1edbn h\u01a1n \u0111\u00e1ng k\u1ec3 so v\u1edbi nh\u1eefng ng\u01b0\u1eddi kh\u00e1c Few cities in the world can baffle a GPS system like London can. To start with, there is no grid of thoroughfares that can be used for orientation and routing as you will find in Manhattan or Paris or Tokyo. Instead the city\u2019s major streets are set at odd angles to each other. They curve and they squiggle. One-way streets abound, there are traffic circles and dead ends all over, and through the middle of everything runs the Thames River, spanned by a dozen bridges in central London, at least one of which\u2014and sometimes more\u2014will likely have to be crossed during a trip of any length through the city. And the erratic numbering system doesn\u2019t always tell you exactly where to find a particular address even when you\u2019ve found the right street. Thus the best advice for visitors is to forget about renting a car with a navigational system and instead rely on the city\u2019s cabbies. They\u2019re ubiquitous\u2014some twenty-five thousand of them driving around in their big, black, boxy cars that are the automotive equivalent of sensible shoes\u2014and they are astonishingly good at getting you from point A to point B in the most efficient way possible, taking into account not only the lengths of the various possible paths, but the time of day, the expected traffic, temporary roadwork and road closings, and any other details that might be relevant to the trip. Nor do points A and B have to be traditional street addresses. Suppose you\u2019d like to revisit that funky little hat shop in Charing Cross whose name you don\u2019t quite recall\u2014Lord\u2019s or Lear or something like that\u2014but you do remember that there is a little shop next door that sells cupcakes. Well, that will be enough. Tell all that to your cabbie, and as soon as is automotively possible you will find yourself in front of Laird London, 23A New Row. As you might imagine, given the challenges of finding one\u2019s way in London, not just anyone can be a cabbie. Indeed, to become a licensed London taxi driver one must pass a series of examinations that have been described as, collectively, the most difficult test in the world. The test is administered by Transport for London, and that agency describes \u201cthe Knowledge\u201d\u2014what a prospective driver must learn\u2014as follows: To achieve the required standard to be licensed as an \u201cAll London\u201d taxi driver you will need a thorough knowledge, primarily, of the area within a six-mile radius of Charing Cross. You will need to know: all the streets; housing estates; parks and open spaces; government offices and departments; financial and commercial centres; diplomatic premises; town halls; registry offices; hospitals; places of worship; sports stadiums and leisure centres; airline offices; stations; hotels; clubs; theatres; cinemas; museums; art galleries; schools; colleges and universities; police stations and headquarters buildings; civil, criminal and coroner\u2019s courts; prisons; and places of interest to tourists. In fact, anywhere a taxi passenger might ask to be taken. That area within six miles of Charing Cross contains approximately twenty-five thousand streets. But a prospective cabbie must be familiar with more than just streets and buildings. Any landmark is fair game. According to a 2014 story about London taxi drivers in the New York Times Magazine, one prospective driver was asked about the location of a statue of two mice with a piece of cheese; the statue, on the fa\u00e7ade of a building, was just one foot tall. More to the point, prospective taxi drivers must demonstrate that they can get from one point in the city to another as efficiently as possible. Tests consist of a series of \u201cruns\u201d in which the examiner gives two points in London and the examinee must provide the precise location of each of the points and then describe the best route between them, turn by turn, naming each street in the sequence. Each run earns a numerical score based on its accuracy, and as the prospective driver accumulates points, the tests get harder and harder, with the endpoints becoming more obscure and the routes longer, more complicated, and more convoluted. Half or more of the prospective drivers end up dropping out, but those who stay with it and earn their licenses have internalized London to a degree that Google Maps, with its satellite images, camera cars, and unfathomable memory and processing power, can only vaguely approximate. To master the Knowledge, prospective cabbies\u2014who are known as \u201cKnowledge boys\u201d and, occasionally, \u201cKnowledge girls\u201d\u2014spend years driving from place to place in London, making notes of what is where and how to get from here to there. The first step is to master a list of 320 runs in the guidebook provided to taxi-driver candidates. For a given run, a candidate will generally first figure out the shortest route by physically traveling the various possible routes, usually by motorbike, and then will explore the areas around the beginning and the end of the run. This means wandering around within a quarter mile or so of each of those places, taking notes on which buildings and which landmarks are in the vicinity. After having repeated this process 320 times, the prospective cabbie has accumulated a foundational set of 320 best routes around London and has also explored\u2014and taken notes on\u2014pretty much every bit of the core area within six miles of Charing Cross. It is a start, but successful candidates keep challenging themselves to determine the best routes for many other runs that are not on the list and to take note of buildings and landmarks that they might have missed before or that might have recently appeared. Indeed, even after passing all the tests and getting licensed, London taxi drivers continue to increase and hone their knowledge of London\u2019s streets. The resulting memory and navigational skills are nothing short of astonishing, and so London taxi drivers have proved irresistible to psychologists interested in learning and, particularly, in the learning of navigational skills. By far the most in-depth studies of the cabbies\u2014and the ones that have the most to tell us about how training affects the brain\u2014have been carried out by Eleanor Maguire, a neuroscientist at University College London. In one of her earliest works on the taxi drivers, published in 2000, Maguire used magnetic resonance imaging to look at the brains of sixteen male taxi drivers and compare them with the brains of fifty other males of similar ages who were not taxi drivers. She looked in particular at the hippocampus, that seahorse-shaped part of the brain involved in the development of memories. The hippocampus is particularly engaged by spatial navigation and in remembering the location of things in space. (Each person actually has two hippocampi, one on each side of the brain.) For instance, species of birds that store food in different places and thus must be able to remember the location of these various caches have relatively larger hippocampi than closely related birds that don\u2019t store food in different places. More to the point, the size of the hippocampus is quite flexible in at least some species of birds and can grow by as much as 30 percent in response to a bird\u2019s food-storing experiences. But would the same thing be true in humans? Maguire found that a particular part of the hippocampus\u2014the posterior, or rear, part\u2014was larger in the taxi drivers than in the other subjects. Furthermore, the more time that a person had spent as a taxi driver, the larger the posterior hippocampi were. In another study that Maguire carried out a few years later, she compared the brains of London taxi drivers with London bus drivers. Like the taxi drivers, the bus drivers spent their days driving around London; the difference between them was that the bus drivers repeated the same routes over and over and thus never had to figure out the best way to get from point A to point B. Maguire found that the posterior hippocampi of the taxi drivers were significantly larger than the same parts of the brain in the bus drivers. The clear implication was that whatever was responsible for the difference in the size of the posterior hippocampi was not related to the driving itself but rather was related specifically to the navigational skills that the job required. That still left one loose end, however: perhaps the taxi drivers in the studies had started out with larger posterior hippocampi that gave them an advantage in finding their way around London, and the extensive testing they went through was nothing more than a weeding-out process that zeroed in on those prospective drivers who were naturally better equipped to be able to learn their way around the maze that is London. Maguire addressed this issue quite simply and powerfully: she followed a group of prospective taxi drivers from the time they started training for their licenses until the point at which all of them had either passed the tests and become licensed cabbies or else had given up and gone on to do something else. In particular, she recruited seventy-nine prospective drivers\u2014all of them male\u2014who were just starting training, as well as another thirty-one males of similar ages to serve as controls. When she scanned all their brains, she found no difference in the sizes of the posterior hippocampi between the prospective drivers and the controls. Four years later she revisited the two groups of subjects. By this time forty-one of the trainees had become licensed London taxi drivers, while thirty-eight had stopped training or failed their tests. So at this point there were three groups to compare: the new taxi drivers who had learned enough about London\u2019s streets to pass the series of tests, the trainees who had not learned enough to pass, and the group who had not ever trained at all. Once again Maguire scanned their brains and calculated the size of the posterior hippocampi in each. What she found would have been no surprise if she had been measuring biceps in bodybuilders, but she wasn\u2019t\u2014she was measuring the sizes of different parts of the brain\u2014and so the result was startling. The volume of the posterior hippocampi had gotten significantly larger in the group of trainees who had continued their training and had become licensed taxi drivers. By contrast, there was no change in the size of the posterior hippocampi among the prospective taxi drivers who had failed to become licensed (either because they simply stopped training or because they could not pass the tests) or among the subjects who had never had anything to do with the taxi training program. The years spent mastering the Knowledge had enlarged precisely that part of the brain that is responsible for navigating from one place to another. Maguire\u2019s study, which was published in 2011, is perhaps the most dramatic evidence we have that the human brain grows and changes in response to intense training. Furthermore, the clear implication of her study is that the extra neurons and other tissue in the posterior hippocampi of the licensed cabbies underlie their increased navigational capabilities. You can think about the posterior hippocampi of a London taxi driver as the neural equivalent of the massively developed arms and shoulders of a male gymnast. Years of work on the rings and pommel horse and parallel bars and floor exercises have built muscles that are exquisitely suited for the sorts of movements he performs on those different pieces of apparatus\u2014and, indeed, that make it possible for him to do all sorts of gymnastics moves that were simply not within his reach when he began training. The posterior hippocampi of the taxi drivers are equally \u201cbulked up,\u201d but with brain tissue, not muscle fiber. ADAPTABILITY N\u00e3o b\u1ed9 con ng\u01b0\u1eddi c\u00f3 kh\u1ea3 n\u0103ng th\u00edch \u1ee9ng t\u1ed1i Until the first decade of the twenty-first century, most scientists would have flat out denied that something like what Maguire has seen in the brains of London cabbies was even possible. The general belief was that once a person reached adulthood, the wiring of his or her brain was pretty much fixed. Sure, everyone understood that there had to be tweaks here and there when you learned something new, but these were thought to be little more than the strengthening of some neural connections and the weakening of others, because the overall structure of the brain and its various neural networks were fixed. This idea went hand in hand with the belief that individual differences in abilities were due mainly to genetically determined differences in the brain\u2019s wiring and that learning was just a way of fulfilling one\u2019s genetic potential. One common metaphor depicted the brain as a computer: learning was like loading some data or installing new software\u2014it allowed you to do some things you couldn\u2019t do before, but your ultimate performance would always be limited by such things as the number of bytes in your random-access memory (RAM) and the power of your central processing unit (CPU). By contrast, the body\u2019s adaptability has always been easier to recognize, as we\u2019ve noted. One of my favorite examples of physical adaptability involves pushups. If you\u2019re a relatively fit male in your twenties, you may be able to do 40 or 50; if you can do 100, you can impress your friends and probably win a few bets. So what might you guess is the world record for pushups\u2014500 or 1,000? In 1980 Minoru Yoshida of Japan did 10,507 pushups nonstop. After that, Guinness World Records stopped accepting submissions for the number of pushups done with no rest periods and switched to the most pushups performed in twenty-four hours with resting allowed. In 1993 Charles Servizio of the United States set what remains the world record in that category by doing 46,001 pushups in 21 hours and 21 minutes. Or consider pull-ups. Even relatively fit guys can generally do only 10 or 15, although if you\u2019ve really been working out, you may have worked your way up to 40 or 50. In 2014 Jan Kare\u0161 of the Czech Republic did 4,654 in twelve hours. In short, the human body is incredibly adaptable. It is not just the skeletal muscles, but also the heart, the lungs, the circulatory system, the body\u2019s energy stores, and more\u2014everything that goes into physical strength and stamina. There may be limits, but there is no indication that we have reached them yet. From Maguire\u2019s work and that of others, we\u2019re now learning that the brain has a very similar degree and variety of adaptability. Some of the earliest observations of this sort of adaptability\u2014or \u201cplasticity,\u201d as neuroscientists would say\u2014appeared in studies of how the brains of blind or deaf people \u201crewire\u201d themselves to find new uses for the parts of the brain that are normally dedicated to processing sights or sounds but that in these people have nothing to do. Most blind people cannot see because of problems with their eyes or optic nerve, but the visual cortex and other parts of the brain are still fully functional; they\u2019re just not getting any input from the eyes. If the brain actually were hardwired like a computer, these visual regions would sit forever idle. We now know, however, that the brain reroutes some of its neurons so that these otherwise-unused areas are put to work doing other things, particularly things related to the remaining senses, which blind people must rely on to get information about their surroundings. To read, for example, the blind run their fingertips over the raised dots that make up the Braille alphabet. When researchers use MRI machines to watch the brains of blind subjects as they read words in Braille, one of the parts of the brain that they see lighting up is the visual cortex. In people with normal sight, the visual cortex would light up in response to input from the eyes, not the fingertips, but in the blind, the visual cortex helps them interpret the fingertip sensations they get from brushing over the groups of raised dots that make up the Braille letters. Ch\u1eef n\u1ed5i Braille Interestingly enough, it is not just otherwise-unused areas of the brain where rewiring occurs. If you practice something enough, your brain will repurpose neurons to help with the task even if they already have another job to do. Perhaps the most compelling evidence of this comes from an experiment done in the late 1990s, when a group of researchers examined the parts of the brain that controlled various fingers on the hands of a group of highly skilled Braille readers. The subjects were three-fingered Braille readers\u2014that is, they used their index fingers to read the patterns of dots that make up individual letters, their middle fingers to pick out the spaces between the letters, and their ring fingers to keep track of the particular line they were reading. The wiring in the part of the brain that controls the hands is normally set up so that each individual finger has a distinct part of the brain dedicated to it. This is what makes it possible for us to tell, for example, which fingertip is being touched by a pencil tip or a thumbtack without looking at our fingers. The subjects in the study were Braille instructors who used their fingers to read Braille several hours each day. What the researchers discovered was that this steady use of the three fingers had caused the areas of the brain devoted to each of those fingers to grow so much that those areas eventually overlapped. As a result, the subjects were exceptionally sensitive to touch on these fingers\u2014they could detect a much gentler touch than sighted subjects\u2014but they often couldn\u2019t tell which of the three fingers had been touched. These studies of brain plasticity in blind subjects\u2014and similar studies in deaf subjects\u2014tell us that the brain\u2019s structure and function are not fixed. They change in response to use. It is possible to shape the brain\u2014your brain, my brain, anybody\u2019s brain\u2014in the ways that we desire through conscious, deliberate training. Researchers are just beginning to explore the various ways that this plasticity can be put to work. One of the most striking results to date could have implications for anyone who suffers from age-related farsightedness\u2014which is just about everyone over the age of fifty. The study, which was carried out by American and Israeli neuroscientists and vision researchers, was reported in 2012. Those scientists assembled a group of middle-aged volunteers, all of whom had difficulty focusing on nearby objects. The official name of the condition is presbyopia, and it results from a problem with the eye itself, which loses elasticity in its lens, making it more difficult to focus well enough to make out small details. There is also an associated difficulty in detecting contrasts between light and dark areas, which exacerbates the difficulty in focusing. The consequences are a boon for optometrists and opticians and a bother for the over-fifty crowd, nearly all of whom need glasses to read or perform close-up work. The researchers had their subjects come into the lab three or so times a week for three months and spend thirty minutes each visit training their vision. The subjects were asked to spot a small image against a background that was very similar in shade to the spot; that is, there was very little contrast between the image and the background. Spotting these images required intense concentration and effort. Over time the subjects learned to more quickly and accurately determine the presence of these images. At the end of three months the subjects were tested to see what size type they could read. On average they were able to read letters that were 60 percent smaller than they could at the beginning of the training, and every single subject had improved. Furthermore, after the training every subject was able to read a newspaper without glasses, something a majority of them couldn\u2019t do beforehand. They also were able to read faster than before. Surprisingly, none of this improvement was caused by changes in the eyes, which had the same stiffness and difficulty focusing as before. Instead, the improvement was due to changes in the part of the brain that interprets visual signals from the eye. Although the researchers couldn\u2019t pinpoint exactly what those changes were, they believe that the brain learned to \u201cde-blur\u201d images. Blurry images result from a combination of two different weaknesses in vision\u2014an inability to see small details and difficulties in detecting differences in contrast\u2014and both of these issues can be helped by the image processing carried out in the brain, in much the same way that image-processing software in a computer or a camera can sharpen an image by such techniques as manipulating the contrast. The researchers who carried out the study believe that their training exercises taught the subjects\u2019 brains to do a better job of processing, which in turn allowed the subjects to discern smaller details without any improvement in the signal from the eyes. CHALLENGING HOMEOSTASIS Why should the human body and brain be so adaptable in the first place? It all stems, ironically enough, from the fact that the individual cells and tissues try to keep everything the same as much as possible. The human body has a preference for stability. It maintains a steady internal temperature. It keeps a stable blood pressure and heart rate. It keeps the blood glucose levels and pH balance (acidity/alkalinity level) steady. It maintains a reasonably constant weight from day to day. None of these things are completely static, of course\u2014pulse rate increases with exercise, for instance, and body weight goes up or down with overeating or dieting\u2014but these changes are usually temporary, and the body eventually gets back to where it was. The technical term for this is \u201chomeostasis,\u201d which simply refers to the tendency of a system\u2014any sort of system, but most often a living creature or some part of a living creature\u2014to act in a way that maintains its own stability. Individual cells like stability as well. They maintain a certain level of water and also regulate the balance of positive and negative ions, particularly sodium and potassium ions, and various small molecules by controlling which ions and molecules stay and which exit through the cell membrane. More important to us is the fact that cells require a stable environment if they are to function effectively. If the surrounding tissues get too hot or too cold, if their fluid level moves too far outside of the preferred range, if the oxygen level drops too far, or if the energy supplies get too low, it damages the functioning of the cells. If the changes are too big for too long, the cells start to die. Thus, the body is equipped with various feedback mechanisms that act to maintain the status quo. Consider what happens when you engage in some sort of vigorous physical activity. The contraction of muscle fibers causes the individual muscle cells to expend their supplies of energy and oxygen, which are replenished from nearby blood vessels. But now the level of oxygen and energy supplies in the bloodstream drops, which leads the body to take various measures in response. The breathing rate goes up to increase oxygen levels in the blood and to clear out more carbon dioxide. Various energy stores are converted into the sort of energy supply that the muscles can use and feed into the bloodstream. Meanwhile, blood circulation increases in order to better distribute the oxygen and energy supplies to those parts of the body that need them. As long as the physical exercise is not so strenuous that it strains the body\u2019s homeostatic mechanisms, the exercise will do very little to prompt physical changes in the body. From the body\u2019s perspective, there is no reason to change; everything is working as it should. It\u2019s a different matter when you engage in a sustained, vigorous physical activity that pushes the body beyond the point where the homeostatic mechanisms can compensate. Your body\u2019s systems and cells find themselves in abnormal states, with abnormally low levels of oxygen and various energy-related compounds, such as glucose, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The metabolism of the various cells can no longer proceed as usual, so there are different sets of biochemical reactions going on in the cells, producing an entirely different suite of biochemical products than the cell usually produces. The cells are not happy with this altered state of affairs, and they respond by calling up some different genes from the cells\u2019 DNA. (Most of the genes in the DNA of a cell are inactive at any given time, and the cell will \u201cswitch on\u201d and \u201cswitch off\u201d various genes, depending on what it needs at the time.) These newly activated genes will switch on or ramp up various biochemical systems within the cell, which will change its behavior in ways that are intended to respond to the fact that the cells and surrounding systems have been pushed out of their comfort zone. The exact details of what goes on inside a cell in response to such stresses are extremely complicated, and researchers are only just now beginning to unravel them. For example, in one study on rats the scientists conducting the study counted 112 different genes that were turned on when the workload on a particular muscle in the rear legs of the rats was sharply increased. Judging by the particular genes that were switched on, the response included such things as a change in the metabolism of the muscle cells, changes in their structure, and a change in the rate at which new muscle cells were formed. The eventual result of all of these changes was a strengthening of the rats\u2019 muscles so that they could handle the increased workload. They had been pushed out of their comfort zone, and the muscles responded by getting strong enough to establish a new comfort zone. Homeostasis had been reestablished. This is the general pattern for how physical activity creates changes in the body: when a body system\u2014certain muscles, the cardiovascular system, or something else\u2014is stressed to the point that homeostasis can no longer be maintained, the body responds with changes that are intended to reestablish homeostasis. Suppose, for example, that you begin a program of aerobic exercise\u2014say, jogging three times a week for half an hour each time, keeping your heart rate at the recommended level of 70 percent of your maximum heart rate (which works out to something over 140 beats per minute for younger adults). The sustained activity will, among other things, lead to low levels of oxygen in the capillaries that supply your leg muscles. Your body will respond by growing new capillaries in order to provide more oxygen to the muscle cells in your legs and return them to their comfort zone. This is how the body\u2019s desire for homeostasis can be harnessed to drive changes: push it hard enough and for long enough, and it will respond by changing in ways that make that push easier to do. You will have gotten a little stronger, built a little more endurance, developed a little more coordination. But there is a catch: once the compensatory changes have occurred\u2014new muscle fibers have grown and become more efficient, new capillaries have grown, and so on\u2014the body can handle the physical activity that had previously stressed it. It is comfortable again. The changes stop. So to keep the changes happening, you have to keep upping the ante: run farther, run faster, run uphill. If you don\u2019t keep pushing and pushing and pushing some more, the body will settle into homeostasis, albeit at a different level than before, and you will stop improving. This explains the importance of staying just outside your comfort zone: you need to continually push to keep the body\u2019s compensatory changes coming, but if you push too far outside your comfort zone, you risk injuring yourself and actually setting yourself back. This, at least, is the way the body responds to physical activity. Scientists know much less about how the brain changes in response to mental challenges. One major difference between the body and the brain is that the cells in the adult brain do not generally divide and form new brain cells. There are a few exceptions, such as in the hippocampus, where new neurons can grow, but in most parts of the brain the changes that occur in response to a mental challenge\u2014such as the contrast training used to improve people\u2019s vision\u2014won\u2019t include the development of new neurons. Instead, the brain rewires those networks in various ways\u2014by strengthening or weakening the various connections between neurons and also by adding new connections or getting rid of old ones. There can also be an increase in the amount of myelin, the insulating sheath that forms around nerve cells and allows nerve signals to travel more quickly; myelination can increase the speed of nerve impulses by as much as ten times. Because these networks of neurons are responsible for thought, memories, controlling movement, interpreting sensory signals, and all the other functions of the brain, rewiring and speeding up these networks can make it possible to do various things\u2014reading a newspaper without glasses, say, or quickly determining the best route from point A to point B\u2014that one couldn\u2019t do before. In the brain, the greater the challenge, the greater the changes\u2014up to a point. Recent studies have shown that learning a new skill is much more effective at triggering structural changes in the brain than simply continuing to practice a skill that one has already learned. On the other hand, pushing too hard for too long can lead to burnout and ineffective learning. The brain, like the body, changes most quickly in that sweet spot where it is pushed outside\u2014but not too far outside\u2014its comfort zone. SHAPING THE BRAIN The fact that the human brain and body respond to challenges by developing new abilities underlies the effectiveness of purposeful and deliberate practice. The training of a London taxi driver or an Olympic gymnast or a violinist at a music academy is, in essence, a method of harnessing the adaptability of the brain and body to develop abilities that would otherwise be out of reach. The best place to see this in action is in the development of musical ability. Over the past two decades brain researchers have studied in great detail how musical training affects the brain and how those effects in turn make possible extraordinary musical performance. The best known study was published in 1995 in the journal Science. Working with four German scientists, the psychologist Edward Taub at the University of Alabama at Birmingham recruited six violinists, two cellists, and a guitarist, all of whom were right-handed, to have their brains scanned. They also recruited six nonmusicians to serve as controls against whom the musicians would be compared. Taub wanted to see if there was any difference between the two groups in the areas of their brains that were devoted to controlling their fingers. Taub was most interested in the fingers on the musicians\u2019 left hands. Playing the violin, cello, or guitar requires exceptional control of those fingers. The fingers move up and down the neck of the instrument and from string to string, sometimes at incredible speeds, and they must be placed with extreme accuracy. Furthermore, many of the sounds coaxed from the instruments, such as vibrato, involve some sliding or vibrating motion of a finger in place, which generally requires extensive practice to master. The left thumb has fewer responsibilities, mainly just providing pressure on the back of the neck, and the right hand generally has much less to do than the left\u2014mostly just holding the bow for violinists and cellists and strumming or picking for guitarists. In short, most of a string player\u2019s training is aimed at improving control of the fingers on the left hand. The question Taub asked was, What effect will this have on the brain? Taub\u2019s team used a magnetoencephalograph\u2014a machine that maps out brain activity by detecting tiny magnetic fields in the brain\u2014to determine which parts of the subjects\u2019 brains controlled which fingers. In particular, the experimenters would touch a subject\u2019s individual fingers and observe which parts of the brain responded to each touch. They found that the region of the brain controlling the left hand was significantly larger in the musicians than in the nonmusicians\u2014and, in particular, that the brain regions controlling the fingers had taken over a section of the brain region that was normally devoted to the palm. Furthermore, the earlier a musician had started to play his or her instrument, the greater the expansion was. By contrast, the researchers found no difference between the musicians and nonmusicians in the size of the region controlling the fingers of the right hand. The implication was clear: Years of practice on a stringed instrument had caused the area of the brain that controls the fingers of the left hand to gradually expand, resulting in a greater ability to control those fingers. In the twenty years since that study, other researchers have expanded on the results and described a variety of ways that musical training affects brain structure and function. For example, the cerebellum\u2014a part of the brain that plays an important role in controlling movements\u2014is larger in musicians than in nonmusicians, and the more hours of training a musician has put in, the larger the cerebellum is. Musicians have more gray matter\u2014the brain tissue that contains neurons\u2014than nonmusicians do in various parts of the cortex, including the somatosensory region (touch and other senses), the superior parietal region (sensory input from the hands), and the premotor cortex (planning movements and guiding movements in space). The details of exactly what happens to which region of the brain can be daunting to anyone who is not trained in neuroscience, but the big picture is clear: musical training modifies the structure and function of the brain in various ways that result in an increased capacity for playing music. In other words, the most effective forms of practice are doing more than helping you learn to play a musical instrument; they are actually increasing your ability to play. With such practice you are modifying the parts of the brain you use when playing music and, in a sense, increasing your own musical \u201ctalent.\u201d Although less of this sort of research has been done in areas other than music, in every area that scientists have studied, the findings are the same: long-term training results in changes in those parts of the brain that are relevant to the particular skill being developed. Some of these studies have focused on purely intellectual skills, such as mathematical ability. For example, the inferior parietal lobule has significantly more gray matter in mathematicians than in nonmathematicians. This part of the brain is involved in mathematical calculations and in visualizing objects in space, something that is important in many areas of math. It also happens to be a part of the brain that caught the attention of the neuroscientists who examined Albert Einstein\u2019s brain. They found that Einstein\u2019s inferior parietal lobule was significantly larger than average and that its shape was particularly unusual, which led them to speculate that his inferior parietal lobule may have played a crucial role in his ability to perform abstract mathematical thinking. Could it be that people like Einstein are simply born with beefier-than-usual inferior parietal lobules and thus have some innate capacity to be good at mathematical thinking? You might think so, but the researchers who carried out the study on the size of that part of the brain in mathematicians and nonmathematicians found that the longer someone had worked as a mathematician, the more gray matter he or she had in the right inferior parietal lobule\u2014which would suggest that the increased size was a product of extended mathematical thinking, not something the person was born with. A number of studies have examined skills that have both a mental and a physical component, such as playing music. One recent investigation looked at the brains of glider pilots versus nonpilots and found that the brains of the pilots had more gray area in several different regions, including the left ventral premotor cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the supplementary eye field. These regions seem to be involved in such things as learning to control the stick that one uses to fly a glider, comparing the visual signals that one gets when flying with the body-balance signals that indicate the orientation of the glider, and controlling the movements of the eyes. Even in the case of what we usually think of as purely \u201cphysical skills,\u201d such as swimming or gymnastics, the brain plays a major role because these activities require careful control of the body\u2019s movements, and research has found that practice produces brain changes. For instance, cortical thickness, a way of measuring the amount of gray matter in a brain area, is greater in competitive divers than in nondivers in three specific regions, all of which play a role in visualizing and controlling the movements of the body. Although the specific details vary from skill to skill, the overall pattern is consistent: Regular training leads to changes in the parts of the brain that are challenged by the training. The brain adapts to these challenges by rewiring itself in ways that increase its ability to carry out the functions required by the challenges. This is the basic message that should be taken away from the research on the effects of training on the brain, but there are a few additional details that are worth noting. First, the effects of training on the brain can vary with age in several ways. The most important way is that younger brains\u2014those of children and adolescents\u2014are more adaptable than adult brains are, so training can have larger effects in younger people. Because the young brain is developing in various ways, training at early ages can actually shape the course of later development, leading to significant changes. This is \u201cthe bent-twig effect.\u201d If you push a small twig slightly away from its normal pattern of growth, you can cause a major change in the ultimate location of the branch that grows from that twig; pushing on a branch that is already developed has much less effect. One example of this effect is that adult pianists generally have more white matter in certain regions of the brain than nonmusicians do, with the difference being totally due to the amount of time spent practicing in childhood. The earlier a child gets started on the piano, the more white matter that pianist will have as an adult. So while you can learn to play the piano as an adult, it will not result in the same amount of extra white matter that would be produced if you learned to play as a child. At present no one knows what the practical implications of this are, but, generally speaking, more white matter leads to nerve signals being transmitted more quickly, so it seems likely that practicing the piano as a child will lead to certain neurological advantages that you just can\u2019t match with practice as an adult. A second detail worth noting is that developing certain parts of the brain through prolonged training can come at a cost: in many cases people who have developed one skill or ability to an extraordinary degree seem to have regressed in another area. Maguire\u2019s study of the London taxi drivers provides perhaps the best example. At the end of the four years, when the trainees had either finished the course and become licensed drivers or had stopped trying, she tested her subjects\u2019 memory in two ways. One involved knowing the locations of various London landmarks, and at this the subjects who had become licensed drivers did far better than the rest of the subjects. The second was a standard test of spatial memory\u2014remembering a complex figure after a thirty-minute delay\u2014and on this the licensed drivers did much worse than the group who had never been trained to become taxi drivers. By contrast, the trainees who had dropped out scored about the same as the subjects who had never trained. Because all three groups scored equally well on this memory test at the start of the four-year period, the only explanation was that the licensed cabbies, by developing their memories of London streets, had done something to cause a decline in this other sort of memory. Although we don\u2019t know for sure what caused that, it seems likely that the intense training caused the trainees\u2019 brains to devote an increasingly large segment to this sort of memory, leaving less gray matter to devote to other sorts of memory. Finally, the cognitive and physical changes caused by training require upkeep. Stop training, and they start to go away. Astronauts who spend months in space without gravity to work against come back to Earth and find it difficult to walk. Athletes who have to stop training because of a broken bone or torn ligament lose much of their strength and endurance in the limbs they cannot exercise. Similar things have been seen with athletes who have volunteered for studies in which they must lie in bed for a month or so. Strength fades. Speed diminishes. Endurance wilts. And something similar is true with the brain. When Maguire studied a group of retired London taxi drivers, she found that they had less gray matter in their posterior hippocampi than did active taxi drivers, although they still had more than retired subjects who had never been taxi drivers. Once these taxi drivers had stopped using their navigational memory every day, the brain changes that had been the result of that work started to disappear. BUILDING YOUR OWN POTENTIAL Once we understand the adaptability of the brain and the body in this way, we start to think about human potential in an entirely different light, and it points us to an entirely different approach to learning. Consider this: Most people live lives that are not particularly physically challenging. They sit at a desk, or if they move around, it\u2019s not a lot. They aren\u2019t running and jumping, they aren\u2019t lifting heavy objects or throwing things long distances, and they aren\u2019t performing maneuvers that require tremendous balance and coordination. Thus they settle into a low level of physical capabilities\u2014enough for day-to-day activities and maybe even hiking or biking or playing golf or tennis on the weekends, but far from the level of physical capabilities that a highly trained athlete possesses. These \u201cnormal\u201d people cannot run a mile in under five minutes or ten miles in under an hour; they cannot throw a baseball three hundred feet or hit a golf ball three hundred yards; they cannot do triple gainers off the high board or triple axels on ice skates or triple backflips in a gymnastics floor routine. These are the sorts of things that require far more practice than most people are willing to devote, but\u2014and this is important\u2014they are also the sorts of abilities that can be developed because the human body is so adaptable and responsive to training. The reason that most people don\u2019t possess these extraordinary physical capabilities isn\u2019t because they don\u2019t have the capacity for them, but rather because they\u2019re satisfied to live in the comfortable rut of homeostasis and never do the work that is required to get out of it. They live in the world of \u201cgood enough.\u201d The same thing is true for all the mental activities we engage in, from writing a report to driving a car, from teaching a class to running an organization, from selling houses to performing brain surgery. We learn enough to get by in our day-to-day lives, but once we reach that point, we seldom push to go beyond good enough. We do very little that challenges our brains to develop new gray matter or white matter or to rewire entire sections in the way that an aspiring London taxi driver or violin student might. And, for the most part, that\u2019s okay. \u201cGood enough\u201d is generally good enough. But it\u2019s important to remember that the option exists. If you wish to become significantly better at something, you can. And here is the key difference between the traditional approach to learning and the purposeful-practice or deliberate-practice approaches: The traditional approach is not designed to challenge homeostasis. It assumes, consciously or not, that learning is all about fulfilling your innate potential and that you can develop a particular skill or ability without getting too far out of your comfort zone. In this view, all that you are doing with practice\u2014indeed, all that you can do\u2014is to reach a fixed potential. With deliberate practice, however, the goal is not just to reach your potential but to build it, to make things possible that were not possible before. This requires challenging homeostasis\u2014getting out of your comfort zone\u2014and forcing your brain or your body to adapt. But once you do this, learning is no longer just a way of fulfilling some genetic destiny; it becomes a way of taking control of your destiny and shaping your potential in ways that you choose. The obvious next question is, What is the best way to challenge homeostasis and develop that potential? We will spend much of the rest of the book answering that question, but before we do that, we need to address an issue that we have glossed over in this chapter: What exactly are we trying to improve about our brains? It\u2019s pretty obvious what leads to improved physical abilities. If you build more and larger muscle fibers, you get stronger. If you improve your muscles\u2019 energy reserves, your lung capacity, your heart\u2019s pumping capacity, and the capacity of your circulatory system, you build your endurance. But what changes are you making in your brain as you train to be a musician, a mathematician, a taxi driver, or a surgeon? Surprisingly, there is a common theme to the changes in all of these areas, and understanding that is the key to understanding how people develop extraordinary abilities in any area of human performance with a mental component\u2014which, when you think about it, is just about all of them. We discuss that next.","title":"Harnessing Adaptability"},{"location":"Chap%202%20-%20Peak/#harnessing-adaptability","text":"2 Harnessing Adaptability IF YOU\u2019RE A BODYBUILDER or just someone lifting weights to add some muscle, it is easy to track the results as you challenge your biceps, triceps, quadriceps, pecs, delts, lats, traps, abs, glutes, calves, and hamstrings. A tape measure works, or you can simply look in the mirror and admire your progress. If you\u2019re running or biking or swimming to increase your endurance, you can track your progress by your heart rate, your breathing, and how long you can keep going until your muscles falter due to lactic acid buildup. But if your challenge is mental\u2014becoming proficient at calculus, say, or learning how to play a musical instrument or speak a new language\u2014it\u2019s different. There is no easy way to observe the resulting changes in your brain as it adapts to the increasing demands being placed on it. There is no soreness in your cortex the day after a particularly tough training session. You don\u2019t have to go out and buy new hats because the old ones are now too small. You don\u2019t develop a six-pack on your forehead. And because you can\u2019t see any changes in your brain, it\u2019s easy to assume that there really isn\u2019t much going on. That would be a mistake, however. There is a growing body of evidence that both the structure and the function of the brain change in response to various sorts of mental training, in much the same way as your muscles and cardiovascular system respond to physical training. With the help of such brain-imaging techniques as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), neuroscientists have begun to study how the brains of people with particular skills differ from the brains of people without those skills and to explore which sorts of training produce which types of changes. Although there is still a tremendous amount to learn in this area, we already know enough to have a clear idea of how purposeful practice and deliberate practice work to increase both our physical and mental capabilities and make it possible to do things that we never could before. Much of what we know about how the body adapts to training comes from studies of runners, weightlifters, and various other athletes. Interestingly enough, however, some of the best studies to date of how the brain changes in response to extended training were carried out not with musicians or chess players or mathematicians\u2014some of the more traditional subjects in studies of the effects of practice on performance\u2014but instead with taxi drivers.

To start with, there is no grid of thoroughfares that can be used for orientation and routing as you will find in Manhattan or Paris or Tokyo. Instead the city\u2019s major streets are set at odd angles to each other. They curve and they squiggle. One-way streets abound, there are traffic circles and dead ends all over, and through the middle of everything runs the Thames River, spanned by a dozen bridges in central London, at least one of which\u2014and sometimes more\u2014will likely have to be crossed during a trip of any length through the city. And the erratic numbering system doesn\u2019t always tell you exactly where to find a particular address even when you\u2019ve found the right street. Thus the best advice for visitors is to forget about renting a car with a navigational system and instead rely on the city\u2019s cabbies. They\u2019re ubiquitous\u2014some twenty-five thousand of them driving around in their big, black, boxy cars that are the automotive equivalent of sensible shoes\u2014and they are astonishingly good at getting you from point A to point B in the most efficient way possible, taking into account not only the lengths of the various possible paths, but the time of day, the expected traffic, temporary roadwork and road closings, and any other details that might be relevant to the trip. Nor do points A and B have to be traditional street addresses. Suppose you\u2019d like to revisit that funky little hat shop in Charing Cross whose name you don\u2019t quite recall\u2014Lord\u2019s or Lear or something like that\u2014but you do remember that there is a little shop next door that sells cupcakes. Well, that will be enough. Tell all that to your cabbie, and as soon as is automotively possible you will find yourself in front of Laird London, 23A New Row. As you might imagine, given the challenges of finding one\u2019s way in London, not just anyone can be a cabbie. Indeed, to become a licensed London taxi driver one must pass a series of examinations that have been described as, collectively, the most difficult test in the world. The test is administered by Transport for London, and that agency describes \u201cthe Knowledge\u201d\u2014what a prospective driver must learn\u2014as follows: To achieve the required standard to be licensed as an \u201cAll London\u201d taxi driver you will need a thorough knowledge, primarily, of the area within a six-mile radius of Charing Cross. You will need to know: all the streets; housing estates; parks and open spaces; government offices and departments; financial and commercial centres; diplomatic premises; town halls; registry offices; hospitals; places of worship; sports stadiums and leisure centres; airline offices; stations; hotels; clubs; theatres; cinemas; museums; art galleries; schools; colleges and universities; police stations and headquarters buildings; civil, criminal and coroner\u2019s courts; prisons; and places of interest to tourists. In fact, anywhere a taxi passenger might ask to be taken. That area within six miles of Charing Cross contains approximately twenty-five thousand streets. But a prospective cabbie must be familiar with more than just streets and buildings. Any landmark is fair game. According to a 2014 story about London taxi drivers in the New York Times Magazine, one prospective driver was asked about the location of a statue of two mice with a piece of cheese; the statue, on the fa\u00e7ade of a building, was just one foot tall. More to the point, prospective taxi drivers must demonstrate that they can get from one point in the city to another as efficiently as possible. Tests consist of a series of \u201cruns\u201d in which the examiner gives two points in London and the examinee must provide the precise location of each of the points and then describe the best route between them, turn by turn, naming each street in the sequence. Each run earns a numerical score based on its accuracy, and as the prospective driver accumulates points, the tests get harder and harder, with the endpoints becoming more obscure and the routes longer, more complicated, and more convoluted. Half or more of the prospective drivers end up dropping out, but those who stay with it and earn their licenses have internalized London to a degree that Google Maps, with its satellite images, camera cars, and unfathomable memory and processing power, can only vaguely approximate. To master the Knowledge, prospective cabbies\u2014who are known as \u201cKnowledge boys\u201d and, occasionally, \u201cKnowledge girls\u201d\u2014spend years driving from place to place in London, making notes of what is where and how to get from here to there. The first step is to master a list of 320 runs in the guidebook provided to taxi-driver candidates. For a given run, a candidate will generally first figure out the shortest route by physically traveling the various possible routes, usually by motorbike, and then will explore the areas around the beginning and the end of the run. This means wandering around within a quarter mile or so of each of those places, taking notes on which buildings and which landmarks are in the vicinity. After having repeated this process 320 times, the prospective cabbie has accumulated a foundational set of 320 best routes around London and has also explored\u2014and taken notes on\u2014pretty much every bit of the core area within six miles of Charing Cross. It is a start, but successful candidates keep challenging themselves to determine the best routes for many other runs that are not on the list and to take note of buildings and landmarks that they might have missed before or that might have recently appeared. Indeed, even after passing all the tests and getting licensed, London taxi drivers continue to increase and hone their knowledge of London\u2019s streets. The resulting memory and navigational skills are nothing short of astonishing, and so London taxi drivers have proved irresistible to psychologists interested in learning and, particularly, in the learning of navigational skills. By far the most in-depth studies of the cabbies\u2014and the ones that have the most to tell us about how training affects the brain\u2014have been carried out by Eleanor Maguire, a neuroscientist at University College London. In one of her earliest works on the taxi drivers, published in 2000, Maguire used magnetic resonance imaging to look at the brains of sixteen male taxi drivers and compare them with the brains of fifty other males of similar ages who were not taxi drivers. She looked in particular at the hippocampus, that seahorse-shaped part of the brain involved in the development of memories. The hippocampus is particularly engaged by spatial navigation and in remembering the location of things in space. (Each person actually has two hippocampi, one on each side of the brain.) For instance, species of birds that store food in different places and thus must be able to remember the location of these various caches have relatively larger hippocampi than closely related birds that don\u2019t store food in different places. More to the point, the size of the hippocampus is quite flexible in at least some species of birds and can grow by as much as 30 percent in response to a bird\u2019s food-storing experiences. But would the same thing be true in humans? Maguire found that a particular part of the hippocampus\u2014the posterior, or rear, part\u2014was larger in the taxi drivers than in the other subjects. Furthermore, the more time that a person had spent as a taxi driver, the larger the posterior hippocampi were. In another study that Maguire carried out a few years later, she compared the brains of London taxi drivers with London bus drivers. Like the taxi drivers, the bus drivers spent their days driving around London; the difference between them was that the bus drivers repeated the same routes over and over and thus never had to figure out the best way to get from point A to point B. Maguire found that the posterior hippocampi of the taxi drivers were significantly larger than the same parts of the brain in the bus drivers. The clear implication was that whatever was responsible for the difference in the size of the posterior hippocampi was not related to the driving itself but rather was related specifically to the navigational skills that the job required. That still left one loose end, however: perhaps the taxi drivers in the studies had started out with larger posterior hippocampi that gave them an advantage in finding their way around London, and the extensive testing they went through was nothing more than a weeding-out process that zeroed in on those prospective drivers who were naturally better equipped to be able to learn their way around the maze that is London. Maguire addressed this issue quite simply and powerfully: she followed a group of prospective taxi drivers from the time they started training for their licenses until the point at which all of them had either passed the tests and become licensed cabbies or else had given up and gone on to do something else. In particular, she recruited seventy-nine prospective drivers\u2014all of them male\u2014who were just starting training, as well as another thirty-one males of similar ages to serve as controls. When she scanned all their brains, she found no difference in the sizes of the posterior hippocampi between the prospective drivers and the controls. Four years later she revisited the two groups of subjects. By this time forty-one of the trainees had become licensed London taxi drivers, while thirty-eight had stopped training or failed their tests. So at this point there were three groups to compare: the new taxi drivers who had learned enough about London\u2019s streets to pass the series of tests, the trainees who had not learned enough to pass, and the group who had not ever trained at all. Once again Maguire scanned their brains and calculated the size of the posterior hippocampi in each. What she found would have been no surprise if she had been measuring biceps in bodybuilders, but she wasn\u2019t\u2014she was measuring the sizes of different parts of the brain\u2014and so the result was startling. The volume of the posterior hippocampi had gotten significantly larger in the group of trainees who had continued their training and had become licensed taxi drivers. By contrast, there was no change in the size of the posterior hippocampi among the prospective taxi drivers who had failed to become licensed (either because they simply stopped training or because they could not pass the tests) or among the subjects who had never had anything to do with the taxi training program. The years spent mastering the Knowledge had enlarged precisely that part of the brain that is responsible for navigating from one place to another. Maguire\u2019s study, which was published in 2011, is perhaps the most dramatic evidence we have that the human brain grows and changes in response to intense training. Furthermore, the clear implication of her study is that the extra neurons and other tissue in the posterior hippocampi of the licensed cabbies underlie their increased navigational capabilities. You can think about the posterior hippocampi of a London taxi driver as the neural equivalent of the massively developed arms and shoulders of a male gymnast. Years of work on the rings and pommel horse and parallel bars and floor exercises have built muscles that are exquisitely suited for the sorts of movements he performs on those different pieces of apparatus\u2014and, indeed, that make it possible for him to do all sorts of gymnastics moves that were simply not within his reach when he began training. The posterior hippocampi of the taxi drivers are equally \u201cbulked up,\u201d but with brain tissue, not muscle fiber. ADAPTABILITY N\u00e3o b\u1ed9 con ng\u01b0\u1eddi c\u00f3 kh\u1ea3 n\u0103ng th\u00edch \u1ee9ng t\u1ed1i Until the first decade of the twenty-first century, most scientists would have flat out denied that something like what Maguire has seen in the brains of London cabbies was even possible. The general belief was that once a person reached adulthood, the wiring of his or her brain was pretty much fixed. Sure, everyone understood that there had to be tweaks here and there when you learned something new, but these were thought to be little more than the strengthening of some neural connections and the weakening of others, because the overall structure of the brain and its various neural networks were fixed. This idea went hand in hand with the belief that individual differences in abilities were due mainly to genetically determined differences in the brain\u2019s wiring and that learning was just a way of fulfilling one\u2019s genetic potential. One common metaphor depicted the brain as a computer: learning was like loading some data or installing new software\u2014it allowed you to do some things you couldn\u2019t do before, but your ultimate performance would always be limited by such things as the number of bytes in your random-access memory (RAM) and the power of your central processing unit (CPU). By contrast, the body\u2019s adaptability has always been easier to recognize, as we\u2019ve noted. One of my favorite examples of physical adaptability involves pushups. If you\u2019re a relatively fit male in your twenties, you may be able to do 40 or 50; if you can do 100, you can impress your friends and probably win a few bets. So what might you guess is the world record for pushups\u2014500 or 1,000? In 1980 Minoru Yoshida of Japan did 10,507 pushups nonstop. After that, Guinness World Records stopped accepting submissions for the number of pushups done with no rest periods and switched to the most pushups performed in twenty-four hours with resting allowed. In 1993 Charles Servizio of the United States set what remains the world record in that category by doing 46,001 pushups in 21 hours and 21 minutes. Or consider pull-ups. Even relatively fit guys can generally do only 10 or 15, although if you\u2019ve really been working out, you may have worked your way up to 40 or 50. In 2014 Jan Kare\u0161 of the Czech Republic did 4,654 in twelve hours. In short, the human body is incredibly adaptable. It is not just the skeletal muscles, but also the heart, the lungs, the circulatory system, the body\u2019s energy stores, and more\u2014everything that goes into physical strength and stamina. There may be limits, but there is no indication that we have reached them yet. From Maguire\u2019s work and that of others, we\u2019re now learning that the brain has a very similar degree and variety of adaptability. Some of the earliest observations of this sort of adaptability\u2014or \u201cplasticity,\u201d as neuroscientists would say\u2014appeared in studies of how the brains of blind or deaf people \u201crewire\u201d themselves to find new uses for the parts of the brain that are normally dedicated to processing sights or sounds but that in these people have nothing to do. Most blind people cannot see because of problems with their eyes or optic nerve, but the visual cortex and other parts of the brain are still fully functional; they\u2019re just not getting any input from the eyes. If the brain actually were hardwired like a computer, these visual regions would sit forever idle. We now know, however, that the brain reroutes some of its neurons so that these otherwise-unused areas are put to work doing other things, particularly things related to the remaining senses, which blind people must rely on to get information about their surroundings. To read, for example, the blind run their fingertips over the raised dots that make up the Braille alphabet. When researchers use MRI machines to watch the brains of blind subjects as they read words in Braille, one of the parts of the brain that they see lighting up is the visual cortex. In people with normal sight, the visual cortex would light up in response to input from the eyes, not the fingertips, but in the blind, the visual cortex helps them interpret the fingertip sensations they get from brushing over the groups of raised dots that make up the Braille letters. Ch\u1eef n\u1ed5i Braille Interestingly enough, it is not just otherwise-unused areas of the brain where rewiring occurs. If you practice something enough, your brain will repurpose neurons to help with the task even if they already have another job to do. Perhaps the most compelling evidence of this comes from an experiment done in the late 1990s, when a group of researchers examined the parts of the brain that controlled various fingers on the hands of a group of highly skilled Braille readers. The subjects were three-fingered Braille readers\u2014that is, they used their index fingers to read the patterns of dots that make up individual letters, their middle fingers to pick out the spaces between the letters, and their ring fingers to keep track of the particular line they were reading. The wiring in the part of the brain that controls the hands is normally set up so that each individual finger has a distinct part of the brain dedicated to it. This is what makes it possible for us to tell, for example, which fingertip is being touched by a pencil tip or a thumbtack without looking at our fingers. The subjects in the study were Braille instructors who used their fingers to read Braille several hours each day. What the researchers discovered was that this steady use of the three fingers had caused the areas of the brain devoted to each of those fingers to grow so much that those areas eventually overlapped. As a result, the subjects were exceptionally sensitive to touch on these fingers\u2014they could detect a much gentler touch than sighted subjects\u2014but they often couldn\u2019t tell which of the three fingers had been touched. These studies of brain plasticity in blind subjects\u2014and similar studies in deaf subjects\u2014tell us that the brain\u2019s structure and function are not fixed. They change in response to use. It is possible to shape the brain\u2014your brain, my brain, anybody\u2019s brain\u2014in the ways that we desire through conscious, deliberate training. Researchers are just beginning to explore the various ways that this plasticity can be put to work. One of the most striking results to date could have implications for anyone who suffers from age-related farsightedness\u2014which is just about everyone over the age of fifty. The study, which was carried out by American and Israeli neuroscientists and vision researchers, was reported in 2012. Those scientists assembled a group of middle-aged volunteers, all of whom had difficulty focusing on nearby objects. The official name of the condition is presbyopia, and it results from a problem with the eye itself, which loses elasticity in its lens, making it more difficult to focus well enough to make out small details. There is also an associated difficulty in detecting contrasts between light and dark areas, which exacerbates the difficulty in focusing. The consequences are a boon for optometrists and opticians and a bother for the over-fifty crowd, nearly all of whom need glasses to read or perform close-up work. The researchers had their subjects come into the lab three or so times a week for three months and spend thirty minutes each visit training their vision. The subjects were asked to spot a small image against a background that was very similar in shade to the spot; that is, there was very little contrast between the image and the background. Spotting these images required intense concentration and effort. Over time the subjects learned to more quickly and accurately determine the presence of these images. At the end of three months the subjects were tested to see what size type they could read. On average they were able to read letters that were 60 percent smaller than they could at the beginning of the training, and every single subject had improved. Furthermore, after the training every subject was able to read a newspaper without glasses, something a majority of them couldn\u2019t do beforehand. They also were able to read faster than before. Surprisingly, none of this improvement was caused by changes in the eyes, which had the same stiffness and difficulty focusing as before. Instead, the improvement was due to changes in the part of the brain that interprets visual signals from the eye. Although the researchers couldn\u2019t pinpoint exactly what those changes were, they believe that the brain learned to \u201cde-blur\u201d images. Blurry images result from a combination of two different weaknesses in vision\u2014an inability to see small details and difficulties in detecting differences in contrast\u2014and both of these issues can be helped by the image processing carried out in the brain, in much the same way that image-processing software in a computer or a camera can sharpen an image by such techniques as manipulating the contrast. The researchers who carried out the study believe that their training exercises taught the subjects\u2019 brains to do a better job of processing, which in turn allowed the subjects to discern smaller details without any improvement in the signal from the eyes. CHALLENGING HOMEOSTASIS Why should the human body and brain be so adaptable in the first place? It all stems, ironically enough, from the fact that the individual cells and tissues try to keep everything the same as much as possible. The human body has a preference for stability. It maintains a steady internal temperature. It keeps a stable blood pressure and heart rate. It keeps the blood glucose levels and pH balance (acidity/alkalinity level) steady. It maintains a reasonably constant weight from day to day. None of these things are completely static, of course\u2014pulse rate increases with exercise, for instance, and body weight goes up or down with overeating or dieting\u2014but these changes are usually temporary, and the body eventually gets back to where it was. The technical term for this is \u201chomeostasis,\u201d which simply refers to the tendency of a system\u2014any sort of system, but most often a living creature or some part of a living creature\u2014to act in a way that maintains its own stability. Individual cells like stability as well. They maintain a certain level of water and also regulate the balance of positive and negative ions, particularly sodium and potassium ions, and various small molecules by controlling which ions and molecules stay and which exit through the cell membrane. More important to us is the fact that cells require a stable environment if they are to function effectively. If the surrounding tissues get too hot or too cold, if their fluid level moves too far outside of the preferred range, if the oxygen level drops too far, or if the energy supplies get too low, it damages the functioning of the cells. If the changes are too big for too long, the cells start to die. Thus, the body is equipped with various feedback mechanisms that act to maintain the status quo. Consider what happens when you engage in some sort of vigorous physical activity. The contraction of muscle fibers causes the individual muscle cells to expend their supplies of energy and oxygen, which are replenished from nearby blood vessels. But now the level of oxygen and energy supplies in the bloodstream drops, which leads the body to take various measures in response. The breathing rate goes up to increase oxygen levels in the blood and to clear out more carbon dioxide. Various energy stores are converted into the sort of energy supply that the muscles can use and feed into the bloodstream. Meanwhile, blood circulation increases in order to better distribute the oxygen and energy supplies to those parts of the body that need them. As long as the physical exercise is not so strenuous that it strains the body\u2019s homeostatic mechanisms, the exercise will do very little to prompt physical changes in the body. From the body\u2019s perspective, there is no reason to change; everything is working as it should. It\u2019s a different matter when you engage in a sustained, vigorous physical activity that pushes the body beyond the point where the homeostatic mechanisms can compensate. Your body\u2019s systems and cells find themselves in abnormal states, with abnormally low levels of oxygen and various energy-related compounds, such as glucose, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The metabolism of the various cells can no longer proceed as usual, so there are different sets of biochemical reactions going on in the cells, producing an entirely different suite of biochemical products than the cell usually produces. The cells are not happy with this altered state of affairs, and they respond by calling up some different genes from the cells\u2019 DNA. (Most of the genes in the DNA of a cell are inactive at any given time, and the cell will \u201cswitch on\u201d and \u201cswitch off\u201d various genes, depending on what it needs at the time.) These newly activated genes will switch on or ramp up various biochemical systems within the cell, which will change its behavior in ways that are intended to respond to the fact that the cells and surrounding systems have been pushed out of their comfort zone. The exact details of what goes on inside a cell in response to such stresses are extremely complicated, and researchers are only just now beginning to unravel them. For example, in one study on rats the scientists conducting the study counted 112 different genes that were turned on when the workload on a particular muscle in the rear legs of the rats was sharply increased. Judging by the particular genes that were switched on, the response included such things as a change in the metabolism of the muscle cells, changes in their structure, and a change in the rate at which new muscle cells were formed. The eventual result of all of these changes was a strengthening of the rats\u2019 muscles so that they could handle the increased workload. They had been pushed out of their comfort zone, and the muscles responded by getting strong enough to establish a new comfort zone. Homeostasis had been reestablished. This is the general pattern for how physical activity creates changes in the body: when a body system\u2014certain muscles, the cardiovascular system, or something else\u2014is stressed to the point that homeostasis can no longer be maintained, the body responds with changes that are intended to reestablish homeostasis. Suppose, for example, that you begin a program of aerobic exercise\u2014say, jogging three times a week for half an hour each time, keeping your heart rate at the recommended level of 70 percent of your maximum heart rate (which works out to something over 140 beats per minute for younger adults). The sustained activity will, among other things, lead to low levels of oxygen in the capillaries that supply your leg muscles. Your body will respond by growing new capillaries in order to provide more oxygen to the muscle cells in your legs and return them to their comfort zone. This is how the body\u2019s desire for homeostasis can be harnessed to drive changes: push it hard enough and for long enough, and it will respond by changing in ways that make that push easier to do. You will have gotten a little stronger, built a little more endurance, developed a little more coordination. But there is a catch: once the compensatory changes have occurred\u2014new muscle fibers have grown and become more efficient, new capillaries have grown, and so on\u2014the body can handle the physical activity that had previously stressed it. It is comfortable again. The changes stop. So to keep the changes happening, you have to keep upping the ante: run farther, run faster, run uphill. If you don\u2019t keep pushing and pushing and pushing some more, the body will settle into homeostasis, albeit at a different level than before, and you will stop improving. This explains the importance of staying just outside your comfort zone: you need to continually push to keep the body\u2019s compensatory changes coming, but if you push too far outside your comfort zone, you risk injuring yourself and actually setting yourself back. This, at least, is the way the body responds to physical activity. Scientists know much less about how the brain changes in response to mental challenges. One major difference between the body and the brain is that the cells in the adult brain do not generally divide and form new brain cells. There are a few exceptions, such as in the hippocampus, where new neurons can grow, but in most parts of the brain the changes that occur in response to a mental challenge\u2014such as the contrast training used to improve people\u2019s vision\u2014won\u2019t include the development of new neurons. Instead, the brain rewires those networks in various ways\u2014by strengthening or weakening the various connections between neurons and also by adding new connections or getting rid of old ones. There can also be an increase in the amount of myelin, the insulating sheath that forms around nerve cells and allows nerve signals to travel more quickly; myelination can increase the speed of nerve impulses by as much as ten times. Because these networks of neurons are responsible for thought, memories, controlling movement, interpreting sensory signals, and all the other functions of the brain, rewiring and speeding up these networks can make it possible to do various things\u2014reading a newspaper without glasses, say, or quickly determining the best route from point A to point B\u2014that one couldn\u2019t do before. In the brain, the greater the challenge, the greater the changes\u2014up to a point. Recent studies have shown that learning a new skill is much more effective at triggering structural changes in the brain than simply continuing to practice a skill that one has already learned. On the other hand, pushing too hard for too long can lead to burnout and ineffective learning. The brain, like the body, changes most quickly in that sweet spot where it is pushed outside\u2014but not too far outside\u2014its comfort zone. SHAPING THE BRAIN The fact that the human brain and body respond to challenges by developing new abilities underlies the effectiveness of purposeful and deliberate practice. The training of a London taxi driver or an Olympic gymnast or a violinist at a music academy is, in essence, a method of harnessing the adaptability of the brain and body to develop abilities that would otherwise be out of reach. The best place to see this in action is in the development of musical ability. Over the past two decades brain researchers have studied in great detail how musical training affects the brain and how those effects in turn make possible extraordinary musical performance. The best known study was published in 1995 in the journal Science. Working with four German scientists, the psychologist Edward Taub at the University of Alabama at Birmingham recruited six violinists, two cellists, and a guitarist, all of whom were right-handed, to have their brains scanned. They also recruited six nonmusicians to serve as controls against whom the musicians would be compared. Taub wanted to see if there was any difference between the two groups in the areas of their brains that were devoted to controlling their fingers. Taub was most interested in the fingers on the musicians\u2019 left hands. Playing the violin, cello, or guitar requires exceptional control of those fingers. The fingers move up and down the neck of the instrument and from string to string, sometimes at incredible speeds, and they must be placed with extreme accuracy. Furthermore, many of the sounds coaxed from the instruments, such as vibrato, involve some sliding or vibrating motion of a finger in place, which generally requires extensive practice to master. The left thumb has fewer responsibilities, mainly just providing pressure on the back of the neck, and the right hand generally has much less to do than the left\u2014mostly just holding the bow for violinists and cellists and strumming or picking for guitarists. In short, most of a string player\u2019s training is aimed at improving control of the fingers on the left hand. The question Taub asked was, What effect will this have on the brain? Taub\u2019s team used a magnetoencephalograph\u2014a machine that maps out brain activity by detecting tiny magnetic fields in the brain\u2014to determine which parts of the subjects\u2019 brains controlled which fingers. In particular, the experimenters would touch a subject\u2019s individual fingers and observe which parts of the brain responded to each touch. They found that the region of the brain controlling the left hand was significantly larger in the musicians than in the nonmusicians\u2014and, in particular, that the brain regions controlling the fingers had taken over a section of the brain region that was normally devoted to the palm. Furthermore, the earlier a musician had started to play his or her instrument, the greater the expansion was. By contrast, the researchers found no difference between the musicians and nonmusicians in the size of the region controlling the fingers of the right hand. The implication was clear: Years of practice on a stringed instrument had caused the area of the brain that controls the fingers of the left hand to gradually expand, resulting in a greater ability to control those fingers. In the twenty years since that study, other researchers have expanded on the results and described a variety of ways that musical training affects brain structure and function. For example, the cerebellum\u2014a part of the brain that plays an important role in controlling movements\u2014is larger in musicians than in nonmusicians, and the more hours of training a musician has put in, the larger the cerebellum is. Musicians have more gray matter\u2014the brain tissue that contains neurons\u2014than nonmusicians do in various parts of the cortex, including the somatosensory region (touch and other senses), the superior parietal region (sensory input from the hands), and the premotor cortex (planning movements and guiding movements in space). The details of exactly what happens to which region of the brain can be daunting to anyone who is not trained in neuroscience, but the big picture is clear: musical training modifies the structure and function of the brain in various ways that result in an increased capacity for playing music. In other words, the most effective forms of practice are doing more than helping you learn to play a musical instrument; they are actually increasing your ability to play. With such practice you are modifying the parts of the brain you use when playing music and, in a sense, increasing your own musical \u201ctalent.\u201d Although less of this sort of research has been done in areas other than music, in every area that scientists have studied, the findings are the same: long-term training results in changes in those parts of the brain that are relevant to the particular skill being developed. Some of these studies have focused on purely intellectual skills, such as mathematical ability. For example, the inferior parietal lobule has significantly more gray matter in mathematicians than in nonmathematicians. This part of the brain is involved in mathematical calculations and in visualizing objects in space, something that is important in many areas of math. It also happens to be a part of the brain that caught the attention of the neuroscientists who examined Albert Einstein\u2019s brain. They found that Einstein\u2019s inferior parietal lobule was significantly larger than average and that its shape was particularly unusual, which led them to speculate that his inferior parietal lobule may have played a crucial role in his ability to perform abstract mathematical thinking. Could it be that people like Einstein are simply born with beefier-than-usual inferior parietal lobules and thus have some innate capacity to be good at mathematical thinking? You might think so, but the researchers who carried out the study on the size of that part of the brain in mathematicians and nonmathematicians found that the longer someone had worked as a mathematician, the more gray matter he or she had in the right inferior parietal lobule\u2014which would suggest that the increased size was a product of extended mathematical thinking, not something the person was born with. A number of studies have examined skills that have both a mental and a physical component, such as playing music. One recent investigation looked at the brains of glider pilots versus nonpilots and found that the brains of the pilots had more gray area in several different regions, including the left ventral premotor cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the supplementary eye field. These regions seem to be involved in such things as learning to control the stick that one uses to fly a glider, comparing the visual signals that one gets when flying with the body-balance signals that indicate the orientation of the glider, and controlling the movements of the eyes. Even in the case of what we usually think of as purely \u201cphysical skills,\u201d such as swimming or gymnastics, the brain plays a major role because these activities require careful control of the body\u2019s movements, and research has found that practice produces brain changes. For instance, cortical thickness, a way of measuring the amount of gray matter in a brain area, is greater in competitive divers than in nondivers in three specific regions, all of which play a role in visualizing and controlling the movements of the body. Although the specific details vary from skill to skill, the overall pattern is consistent: Regular training leads to changes in the parts of the brain that are challenged by the training. The brain adapts to these challenges by rewiring itself in ways that increase its ability to carry out the functions required by the challenges. This is the basic message that should be taken away from the research on the effects of training on the brain, but there are a few additional details that are worth noting. First, the effects of training on the brain can vary with age in several ways. The most important way is that younger brains\u2014those of children and adolescents\u2014are more adaptable than adult brains are, so training can have larger effects in younger people. Because the young brain is developing in various ways, training at early ages can actually shape the course of later development, leading to significant changes. This is \u201cthe bent-twig effect.\u201d If you push a small twig slightly away from its normal pattern of growth, you can cause a major change in the ultimate location of the branch that grows from that twig; pushing on a branch that is already developed has much less effect. One example of this effect is that adult pianists generally have more white matter in certain regions of the brain than nonmusicians do, with the difference being totally due to the amount of time spent practicing in childhood. The earlier a child gets started on the piano, the more white matter that pianist will have as an adult. So while you can learn to play the piano as an adult, it will not result in the same amount of extra white matter that would be produced if you learned to play as a child. At present no one knows what the practical implications of this are, but, generally speaking, more white matter leads to nerve signals being transmitted more quickly, so it seems likely that practicing the piano as a child will lead to certain neurological advantages that you just can\u2019t match with practice as an adult. A second detail worth noting is that developing certain parts of the brain through prolonged training can come at a cost: in many cases people who have developed one skill or ability to an extraordinary degree seem to have regressed in another area. Maguire\u2019s study of the London taxi drivers provides perhaps the best example. At the end of the four years, when the trainees had either finished the course and become licensed drivers or had stopped trying, she tested her subjects\u2019 memory in two ways. One involved knowing the locations of various London landmarks, and at this the subjects who had become licensed drivers did far better than the rest of the subjects. The second was a standard test of spatial memory\u2014remembering a complex figure after a thirty-minute delay\u2014and on this the licensed drivers did much worse than the group who had never been trained to become taxi drivers. By contrast, the trainees who had dropped out scored about the same as the subjects who had never trained. Because all three groups scored equally well on this memory test at the start of the four-year period, the only explanation was that the licensed cabbies, by developing their memories of London streets, had done something to cause a decline in this other sort of memory. Although we don\u2019t know for sure what caused that, it seems likely that the intense training caused the trainees\u2019 brains to devote an increasingly large segment to this sort of memory, leaving less gray matter to devote to other sorts of memory. Finally, the cognitive and physical changes caused by training require upkeep. Stop training, and they start to go away. Astronauts who spend months in space without gravity to work against come back to Earth and find it difficult to walk. Athletes who have to stop training because of a broken bone or torn ligament lose much of their strength and endurance in the limbs they cannot exercise. Similar things have been seen with athletes who have volunteered for studies in which they must lie in bed for a month or so. Strength fades. Speed diminishes. Endurance wilts. And something similar is true with the brain. When Maguire studied a group of retired London taxi drivers, she found that they had less gray matter in their posterior hippocampi than did active taxi drivers, although they still had more than retired subjects who had never been taxi drivers. Once these taxi drivers had stopped using their navigational memory every day, the brain changes that had been the result of that work started to disappear. BUILDING YOUR OWN POTENTIAL Once we understand the adaptability of the brain and the body in this way, we start to think about human potential in an entirely different light, and it points us to an entirely different approach to learning. Consider this: Most people live lives that are not particularly physically challenging. They sit at a desk, or if they move around, it\u2019s not a lot. They aren\u2019t running and jumping, they aren\u2019t lifting heavy objects or throwing things long distances, and they aren\u2019t performing maneuvers that require tremendous balance and coordination. Thus they settle into a low level of physical capabilities\u2014enough for day-to-day activities and maybe even hiking or biking or playing golf or tennis on the weekends, but far from the level of physical capabilities that a highly trained athlete possesses. These \u201cnormal\u201d people cannot run a mile in under five minutes or ten miles in under an hour; they cannot throw a baseball three hundred feet or hit a golf ball three hundred yards; they cannot do triple gainers off the high board or triple axels on ice skates or triple backflips in a gymnastics floor routine. These are the sorts of things that require far more practice than most people are willing to devote, but\u2014and this is important\u2014they are also the sorts of abilities that can be developed because the human body is so adaptable and responsive to training. The reason that most people don\u2019t possess these extraordinary physical capabilities isn\u2019t because they don\u2019t have the capacity for them, but rather because they\u2019re satisfied to live in the comfortable rut of homeostasis and never do the work that is required to get out of it. They live in the world of \u201cgood enough.\u201d The same thing is true for all the mental activities we engage in, from writing a report to driving a car, from teaching a class to running an organization, from selling houses to performing brain surgery. We learn enough to get by in our day-to-day lives, but once we reach that point, we seldom push to go beyond good enough. We do very little that challenges our brains to develop new gray matter or white matter or to rewire entire sections in the way that an aspiring London taxi driver or violin student might. And, for the most part, that\u2019s okay. \u201cGood enough\u201d is generally good enough. But it\u2019s important to remember that the option exists. If you wish to become significantly better at something, you can. And here is the key difference between the traditional approach to learning and the purposeful-practice or deliberate-practice approaches: The traditional approach is not designed to challenge homeostasis. It assumes, consciously or not, that learning is all about fulfilling your innate potential and that you can develop a particular skill or ability without getting too far out of your comfort zone. In this view, all that you are doing with practice\u2014indeed, all that you can do\u2014is to reach a fixed potential. With deliberate practice, however, the goal is not just to reach your potential but to build it, to make things possible that were not possible before. This requires challenging homeostasis\u2014getting out of your comfort zone\u2014and forcing your brain or your body to adapt. But once you do this, learning is no longer just a way of fulfilling some genetic destiny; it becomes a way of taking control of your destiny and shaping your potential in ways that you choose. The obvious next question is, What is the best way to challenge homeostasis and develop that potential? We will spend much of the rest of the book answering that question, but before we do that, we need to address an issue that we have glossed over in this chapter: What exactly are we trying to improve about our brains? It\u2019s pretty obvious what leads to improved physical abilities. If you build more and larger muscle fibers, you get stronger. If you improve your muscles\u2019 energy reserves, your lung capacity, your heart\u2019s pumping capacity, and the capacity of your circulatory system, you build your endurance. But what changes are you making in your brain as you train to be a musician, a mathematician, a taxi driver, or a surgeon? Surprisingly, there is a common theme to the changes in all of these areas, and understanding that is the key to understanding how people develop extraordinary abilities in any area of human performance with a mental component\u2014which, when you think about it, is just about all of them. We discuss that next.","title":"Harnessing Adaptability"},{"location":"Chap%203/","text":"3 Mental Representations ON APRIL 27, 1924, shortly before 2:00 p.m., the Russian grandmaster Alexander Alekhine settled into a comfortable leather chair at the front of a large room in the Hotel Alamac in New York City and prepared to play twenty-six of the best chess players in the area. The challengers sat at two long tables behind Alekhine. In front of each challenger was a chessboard on which that player\u2019s game with Alekhine would be played out. Alekhine could see none of the boards. Each time a player made a move, a runner would call out the board number and the move loudly enough that Alekhine could hear it, and then, once Alekhine announced his response, the runner would make Alekhine\u2019s move for him on the appropriate board. Twenty-six boards, 832 individual pieces, and 1,664 individual squares to keep track of\u2014all without taking notes or having any sort of memory aid\u2014and yet Alekhine never stumbled. The demonstration went on for more than twelve hours, with a short break for dinner, and when the last game was finished, shortly after two o\u2019clock in the morning, Alekhine had won sixteen, lost five, and played to a draw in five more. This sort of chess game, in which one of the players\u2014and sometimes both\u2014cannot see the chessboard and must play from memory, is called \u201cblindfold chess\u201d even if there is no literal blindfold involved. Chess masters have been playing blindfolded for more than a thousand years, mostly as a way of showing off, although sometimes as a way of handicapping themselves when playing less-skilled opponents. Some of these old chess masters would even play blindfolded against two, three, or four opponents simultaneously, but it wasn\u2019t until the late nineteenth century that a few grandmasters began to get really serious with it, playing a dozen or more opponents at once. The current record is forty-six boards, set in 2011 by Marc Lang of Germany, with twenty-five wins, two losses, and nineteen draws. Nonetheless, Alekhine\u2019s exhibition in 1924 is still generally considered to be the most impressive simultaneous blindfold match ever because of the quality of his challengers and the number of his wins against such stiff competition. Blindfold chess offers one of the most dramatic examples of what is possible to accomplish with purposeful practice. And learning a bit about blindfold chess can give us a clear idea of the sorts of neurological changes that arise from such practice. THE ACCIDENTAL BLINDFOLD CHESS MASTER Although Alekhine became interested in blindfold chess at an early age and played his first blindfold game when he was twelve, the vast majority of his training throughout his life was devoted not to blindfold chess but simply to chess. Alekhine, who was born in October 1892, started playing chess when he was seven. By the time he was ten, he was playing in correspondence tournaments, and he would spend much of each day analyzing the positions in detail, even while he was in school. Because he could not bring a chessboard with him to class, he would write the position he was studying down on a piece of paper and puzzle over it during school hours. Once in an algebra class he suddenly stood up with a big smile on his face. \u201cWell, have you solved it?\u201d his teacher asked, referring to the algebra problem that the class had been assigned. \u201cYes,\u201d Alekhine responded, \u201cI sacrifice the knight, the bishop moves, . . . and White wins!\u201d He first became interested in blindfold chess around the same time as he began playing in correspondence tournaments. The event that triggered Alekhine\u2019s interest in blindfold chess was a 1902 exhibition in Moscow by the U.S. chess champion Harry Nelson Pillsbury, who set a world record at that exhibition by playing twenty-two games simultaneously. As Alekhine would later tell it, his brother Alexei was one of Pillsbury\u2019s opponents that day, although the records of the match that we have today hold no indication that Alexei actually played. Either way, though, the demonstration made a serious impression on the young Alekhine, and a couple of years later he began to try blindfold chess himself. It was, he later wrote, a natural outgrowth of his habit of thinking about chess positions while he was in the classroom. At first he would sketch out positions and use the sketches to work out the best moves, but eventually he found that he could study the positions just as well without the diagrams\u2014that he could hold the entire chessboard in his memory and move pieces around in his mind, trying various lines of play. Over time Alekhine got to the point where he could play whole games in his mind with no need to look at a chessboard, and, as he got older, he began to play multiple blindfold games in the spirit of Pillsbury\u2019s demonstration. At sixteen he could do four or five blindfold games simultaneously, but he didn\u2019t pursue it any further, choosing instead to focus on improving his play in standard games. By this point it was clear to him that if he worked hard enough, he could become one of the best chess players in the world. And Alekhine, who had never lacked confidence in his abilities at chess, saw no reason to stop at the \u201cone of the\u201d part of that description. His goal was to be the best player, period\u2014the World Chess Champion. Alekhine was well on his way toward that goal when the First World War began, an interruption that rekindled his interest in blindfold chess. In early August 1914, Alekhine and many other chess masters were playing at a major tournament in Berlin when Germany declared war on both Russia and France. Many of the foreign chess players were interned, and Alekhine found himself in a prison with half a dozen of Russia\u2019s other best chess players\u2014but with no chessboards. So until they were released back to Russia\u2014for Alekhine it was more than a month\u2014the chess masters entertained themselves by playing each other in games of blindfold chess. Once back in Russia, Alekhine served with a Red Cross unit on the Austrian front, where in 1916 he suffered a serious injury to his spine and was captured by the Austrians. The Austrians kept him chained to a bed in a hospital for several months as his back healed. Once again he had little but chess to entertain himself, and he arranged for a number of local players to visit and play against him. During that time he regularly played blindfold games, perhaps to handicap himself against his less-skilled opponents. Once he returned to Russia, Alekhine again neglected blindfold chess until after he emigrated to Paris in 1921. At this point Alekhine was actively seeking the World Chess Championship, and he needed some way to support himself during that quest. One of his few options was to give chess demonstrations, and so he began performing simultaneous blindfold matches. The first one he held in Paris was against twelve opponents, which were three or four more than he had ever played. At the end of 1923 he was in Montreal and decided to try to break the North American record for simultaneous blindfold chess games. The North American record at the time was twenty games, held by Pillsbury, so Alekhine played twenty-one. It went well, so he decided to go for the world record, which at the time was twenty-five games. That led to the demonstration at the Hotel Alamac. Over the coming years Alekhine would set the world record twice more\u2014with twenty-eight games in 1925 and thirty-two games in 1933\u2014but he always contended that blindfold chess was little more than a way of bringing attention to the game of chess and, of course, to himself. It was never something that he made a special effort to develop, but rather something that grew out of his relentless effort to master the game and become the best in the world. Alekhine eventually reached his goal, defeating Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca in 1927 for the world championship. He held that title until 1935 and then again from 1937 to 1946, and many rankings place Alekhine among the ten best chess players of all time. But when people rank the greatest blindfold chess players of all time, Alekhine\u2019s name is generally at the very top of the list\u2014even though blindfold chess was never his main focus. If we look at the overall history of blindfold chess, we find that this same thing is true for most blindfold chess players throughout history. They worked to become chess masters, and they found themselves, with little or no additional effort, able to play blindfolded. At first glance, the way that so many grandmasters develop the ability to play blindfold chess might seem nothing more than an artifact, an interesting footnote to the history of chess. But if you look more closely, you find that this connection is actually a clue pointing toward the particular mental processes that set chess masters apart from chess novices and make possible their incredible ability to analyze chess positions and zero in on the best moves. Furthermore, the same sorts of highly developed mental processes are seen in expert performers in every field and hold the key to understanding their extraordinary abilities. Before we delve into this, however, let us take a quick detour to examine in more detail the sort of memory that chess experts have for pieces arranged on a chessboard. THE SECRET TO WINNING CHESS Beginning in the early 1970s researchers sought to understand how grandmasters remember chess positions with such accuracy. The earliest studies were done by my mentor, Herb Simon, working with Bill Chase, who would later be my collaborator in my studies of Steve Faloon\u2019s digit-span memory. It was already known that grandmasters, given just a few seconds to study a chessboard as it appears in the middle of a game, will remember correctly the position of most of the pieces and be able to reproduce the most important areas of the board almost perfectly. This ability seemed to defy the well-known limits of short-term memory. By contrast, someone who is just beginning to play chess can remember the positions of only a handful of pieces and can\u2019t come close to reconstructing the arrangement of pieces on the board. Herb and Bill asked a simple question: Are chess experts recalling the position of each piece, or are they actually remembering patterns, where the individual pieces are seen as part of a larger whole? To answer that question Herb and Bill carried out a simple but effective experiment. They tested a national-level chess player (i.e., a chess master), a mid-range chess player, and a chess novice on two types of boards, one that had the pieces arranged in a pattern taken from a real chess game, and the other with a random jumble of pieces of the sort that made no chess sense at all. When shown chessboards with a dozen to two dozen pieces arranged in a pattern from the middle or the end of a chess game, the master could remember the positions of about two-thirds of the pieces after five seconds of study, the novice could remember only about four, and the mid-range player was somewhere in the middle. When shown chessboards with the pieces arrayed randomly, the novice player did somewhat worse\u2014only about two pieces correct. No surprise there. What was surprising, however, was that neither the mid-range player nor the chess master did much better than the novice in remembering the positions of pieces arranged randomly on a board. They too got only about two or three pieces right. The experienced players\u2019 advantage had disappeared. More recent studies of large groups of chess players have reiterated the original findings. Something very similar has been shown with verbal memory. If you ask someone to recall a seemingly random assortment of words verbatim, starting with the first word\u2014\u201cwas smelled front that his the peanuts he good hunger eating barely woman of so in could that him contain\u201d\u2014the average person will remember only the first six of those words. If, however, you read the same words rearranged into a sentence that makes clear sense\u2014\u201cThe woman in front of him was eating peanuts that smelled so good that he could barely contain his hunger\u201d\u2014some adults will remember all of the words in perfect order, and most people will remember most of the sentence. What\u2019s the difference? The second arrangement carries meaning that allows us to make sense of the words using preexisting \u201cmental representations.\u201d They\u2019re not random; they mean something, and meaning aids memory. Similarly, chess masters don\u2019t develop some incredible memory for where individual pieces sit on a board. Instead, their memory is very context-dependent: it is only for patterns of the sort that would appear in a normal game. The ability to recognize and remember meaningful patterns arises from the way chess players develop their abilities. Anyone who is serious about developing skills on the chessboard will do it mainly by spending countless hours studying games played by the masters. You analyze a position in depth, predicting the next move, and if you get it wrong, you go back and figure out what you missed. Research has shown that the amount of time spent in this sort of analysis\u2014not the amount of time spent playing chess with others\u2014is the single most important predictor of a chess player\u2019s ability. It generally takes about ten years of this sort of practice to reach the level of grandmaster. These years of practice make it possible for chess players to recognize patterns of chess pieces\u2014not just their positions, but the interactions among them\u2014at a glance. They are old friends. Bill Chase and Herb Simon called these patterns \u201cchunks,\u201d and the important thing about them is that they are held in long-term memory. Simon estimated that by the time a chess player becomes a master, he or she has accumulated some fifty thousand of these chunks. A master who examines a chess position sees a collection of chunks that are interacting with other chunks in still other patterns. Research has shown that these chunks are organized hierarchically, with groups of chunks arranged into higher-level patterns. The hierarchy is analogous to the organizational structure of a business or other large institution, with individuals organized into teams, which are organized into units, which are organized into departments, and so on, with the higher-level pieces being more abstracted and further from the bottom level where the real action takes place (which, in the case of the chess example, is the level of the individual chess pieces). The way that grandmasters process and make sense of chess positions is an example of a mental representation. It is their way of \u201cseeing\u201d the board, and it\u2019s quite different from how a novice would see the same board. When asked what they see when they are mentally examining a chess position, grandmasters do not talk about visualizing the physical chess pieces on a board as they would if they were relying on some sort of \u201cphotographic memory\u201d of the position. This would be a \u201cbottom-level\u201d representation. Instead, their descriptions are much more vague, sprinkled with such terms as \u201clines of force\u201d and \u201cpower.\u201d A key thing about these representations is that they allow a chess player to encode the positions of pieces on the board in a much more efficient way than simply remembering which piece is on which square. This efficient encoding underlies a master\u2019s ability to glance at a chessboard and remember the positions of most of the pieces and, in particular, the ability to play blindfold chess. Two other features of these representations are worth noting, for they are examples of themes that will appear again and again as we explore the broader world of mental representations. First, the mental representations are more than just ways of encoding positions. They allow a chess master to glance at a game in progress and get an immediate sense of which side has the advantage, which directions the game might take, and what a good move or moves might be. This is because the representations include, in addition to the positions of the pieces and the interactions between them, the various weaknesses and strengths of the two players\u2019 positions and moves that are likely to be effective in such positions. One of the things that most clearly sets grandmasters apart from novices or mid-range players is their ability to devise much better potential moves when they first examine a position. The second notable characteristic of these mental representations is that while a chess master will initially analyze a position in terms of general patterns\u2014which is enough when playing a lesser opponent\u2014the representations also allow the master to zero in on individual pieces and mentally move them around the board to see how such moves would change the patterns. So the master can quickly examine strings of possible moves and countermoves in great detail, looking for the particular move that will offer the best chance of winning. In short, while the mental representations give masters a view of the forest that novices lack, they also allow masters to zero in on the trees when necessary. MENTAL REPRESENTATIONS Mental representations aren\u2019t just for chess masters; we all use them constantly. A mental representation is a mental structure that corresponds to an object, an idea, a collection of information, or anything else, concrete or abstract, that the brain is thinking about. A simple example is a visual image. Mention the Mona Lisa, for instance, and many people will immediately \u201csee\u201d an image of the painting in their minds; that image is their mental representation of the Mona Lisa. Some people\u2019s representations are more detailed and accurate than others, and they can report, for example, details about the background, about where Mona Lisa is sitting, and about her hairstyle and her eyebrows. A somewhat more complex example of a mental representation is a word\u2014dog, for example. Suppose you\u2019ve never heard of a dog and never seen anything like it. Perhaps you\u2019ve grown up in some isolated place\u2014a desert island, say\u2014where there are no four-legged animals of any sort, only birds and fish and insects. When you\u2019re first introduced to the concept of dog, it is all just isolated data, and the word dog doesn\u2019t really mean much to you; it is just a label for this collection of disconnected knowledge. Dogs are furry, they have four legs, they are meat eaters, they run in packs, the little ones are called puppies, they can be trained, and so on. Gradually, however, as you spend time around dogs and start to understand them, all this information becomes integrated into one holistic concept that is represented by the word dog. Now when you hear that word, you don\u2019t have to search your memory banks to remember all the various details about dogs; instead, all that information is immediately accessible. You have added dog not only to your vocabulary but to your set of mental representations. Much of deliberate practice involves developing ever more efficient mental representations that you can use in whatever activity you are practicing. When Steve Faloon was training to improve his ability to remember long strings of digits, he developed increasingly sophisticated ways to encode those digits mentally\u2014that is, he created mental representations. When London taxi trainees are learning to navigate efficiently from every point A to every point B in the city, they do it by developing increasingly sophisticated mental maps of the city\u2014that is, by making mental representations. Even when the skill being practiced is primarily physical, a major factor is the development of the proper mental representations. Consider a competitive diver working on a new dive. Much of the practice is devoted to forming a clear mental picture of what the dive should look like at every moment and, more importantly, what it should feel like in terms of body positioning and momentum. Of course, the deliberate practice will also lead to physical changes in the body itself\u2014in divers, the development of the legs, abdominal muscles, back, and shoulders, among other body parts\u2014but without the mental representations necessary to produce and control the body\u2019s movements correctly, the physical changes would be of no use. A key fact about such mental representations is that they are very \u201cdomain specific,\u201d that is, they apply only to the skill for which they were developed. We saw this with Steve Faloon: the mental representations he had devised to remember strings of digits did nothing to improve his memory for strings of letters. Similarly, a chess player\u2019s mental representations will give him or her no advantage over others in tests involving general visuospatial abilities, and a diver\u2019s mental representations will be useless for basketball. This explains a crucial fact about expert performance in general: there is no such thing as developing a general skill. You don\u2019t train your memory; you train your memory for strings of digits or for collections of words or for people\u2019s faces. You don\u2019t train to become an athlete; you train to become a gymnast or a sprinter or a marathoner or a swimmer or a basketball player. You don\u2019t train to become a doctor; you train to become a diagnostician or a pathologist or a neurosurgeon. Of course, some people do become overall memory experts or athletes in a number of sports or doctors with a general set of skills, but they do so by training in a number of different areas. Because the details of mental representations can differ dramatically from field to field, it\u2019s hard to offer an overarching definition that is not too vague, but in essence these representations are preexisting patterns of information\u2014facts, images, rules, relationships, and so on\u2014that are held in long-term memory and that can be used to respond quickly and effectively in certain types of situations. The thing all mental representations have in common is that they make it possible to process large amounts of information quickly, despite the limitations of short-term memory. Indeed, one could define a mental representation as a conceptual structure designed to sidestep the usual restrictions that short-term memory places on mental processing. The best example of this that we have seen is Steve Faloon\u2019s ability to recall as many as eighty-two digits when only seven or eight digits would have been possible if he\u2019d had to rely on short-term memory alone. He did it by encoding the digits he was hearing, three or four at a time, into meaningful memories in his long-term memory and then associating these memories with the retrieval structure, which allowed him to remember which digit group followed which. To do all this he needed mental representations not just for the three- and four-digit groups of numbers that he was holding on to but also for the retrieval structure itself, which he visualized as a sort of two-dimensional tree with the three- and four-digit groups placed at the ends of the individual branches. But memorizing lists of things is just the simplest example of how short-term memory comes into play in our lives. We constantly have to hold on to and process many pieces of information simultaneously: the words in a sentence whose meaning we are figuring out, the positions of the pieces on a chessboard, or the different factors we must take into account when driving a car, such as our own speed and momentum, the positions and speeds of other vehicles, the road conditions and visibility, where our foot must be to hit the accelerator or brake, how much force to apply to the pedals, how quickly to turn the steering wheel, and so on. Any relatively complicated activity requires holding more information in our heads than short-term memory allows, so we are always building mental representations of one sort or another without even being aware of it. Indeed, without mental representations we couldn\u2019t walk (too many muscle movements to coordinate), we couldn\u2019t talk (ditto on the muscle movements, plus no understanding of the words), we couldn\u2019t live any sort of human life. So everyone has and uses mental representations. What sets expert performers apart from everyone else is the quality and quantity of their mental representations. Through years of practice, they develop highly complex and sophisticated representations of the various situations they are likely to encounter in their fields\u2014such as the vast number of arrangements of chess pieces that can appear during games. These representations allow them to make faster, more accurate decisions and respond more quickly and effectively in a given situation. This, more than anything else, explains the difference in performance between novices and experts. Consider how professional baseball players are able to consistently hit balls that are pitched toward them at speeds that may exceed ninety miles per hour\u2014something that\u2019s impossible for anyone who hasn\u2019t spent years training in that particular skill. These hitters have just a split second to decide whether to swing and, if so, where to swing. They have no better eyesight than an average person, and their reflexes are no faster. What they have is a set of mental representations developed through years of hitting pitches and getting immediate feedback about their expectations concerning a pitch. These representations enable them to quickly recognize what sort of pitch is coming and where it will likely be when it reaches them. As soon as they see the pitcher\u2019s arm come around and the ball leave his hand, they have a very good idea\u2014without having to do any sort of conscious calculations\u2014whether it will be a fastball, slider, or curve and approximately where it\u2019s heading. In essence, they\u2019ve learned to read the pitcher\u2019s delivery, so they have less need to actually see how the ball travels before determining whether and where to swing the bat. The rest of us, who are illiterate where pitching is concerned, simply can\u2019t make these decisions before the ball arrives in the catcher\u2019s mitt. So here is a major part of the answer to the question we asked at the end of the last chapter: What exactly is being changed in the brain with deliberate practice? The main thing that sets experts apart from the rest of us is that their years of practice have changed the neural circuitry in their brains to produce highly specialized mental representations, which in turn make possible the incredible memory, pattern recognition, problem solving, and other sorts of advanced abilities needed to excel in their particular specialties. The best way to understand exactly what these mental representations are and how they work is, fittingly enough, to develop a good mental representation of the concept mental representation. And just as was the case with dog, the best way to develop a mental representation of mental representations is to spend a little time getting to know them, stroking their fur, patting their little heads, and watching as they perform their tricks. RECOGNIZING AND RESPONDING TO PATTERNS In pretty much every area, a hallmark of expert performance is the ability to see patterns in a collection of things that would seem random or confusing to people with less well developed mental representations. In other words, experts see the forest when everyone else sees only trees. This is perhaps most obvious in team sports. Take soccer, for instance. You have eleven players on a side moving around in a way that to the uninitiated seems a swirling chaos with no discernible pattern beyond the obvious fact that some players are drawn to the soccer ball whenever it comes near. To those who know and love the game, however, and particularly to those who play the game well, this chaos is no chaos at all. It is all a beautifully nuanced and constantly shifting pattern created as the players move in response to the ball and the movements of the other players. The best players recognize and respond to the patterns almost instantaneously, taking advantage of weaknesses or openings as soon as they appear. To study this phenomenon, I and two colleagues, Paul Ward and Mark Williams, investigated how well soccer players can predict what\u2019s coming next from what has already happened on the field. To do this we showed them videos of real soccer matches and suddenly stopped the video when a player had just received the ball. Then we asked our subjects to predict what would happen next. Would the player with the ball keep it, attempt a shot at the goal, or pass the ball to a teammate? We found that the more accomplished players were much better at deciding what the player with the ball should do. We also tested the players\u2019 memory for where the relevant players were located and in what directions they were moving by asking them to recall as much as they could from the last frame of the video before it was hidden from them. Again, the better players outperformed the weaker ones. We concluded that the advantage better players had in predicting future events was related to their ability to envision more possible outcomes and quickly sift through them and come up with the most promising action. In short, the better players had a more highly developed ability to interpret the pattern of action on the field. This ability allowed them to perceive which players\u2019 movements and interactions mattered most, which allowed them to make better decisions about where to go on the field, when to pass the ball and to whom, and so on. Something very similar is true for football, although it is mainly the quarterback who needs to develop mental representations of events on the field. This explains why the most successful quarterbacks are generally the ones who spend the most time in the film room, watching and analyzing the plays of their own team and their opponents. The best quarterbacks keep track of what\u2019s happening everywhere on the field, and after the game they can generally recall most of the game\u2019s plays, providing detailed descriptions of the movements of many players on each team. More importantly, effective mental representations allow a quarterback to make good decisions quickly: whether to pass the ball, whom to pass to, when to pass, and so on. Being able to make the right decision a tenth of a second faster can be the difference between a good play and a disastrous one\u2014between, say, a completed pass and an interception. Another important fact about mental representations was shown in a 2014 study by German researchers who looked at indoor rock climbing. In this sport, which is designed to mimic and serve as training for outdoor rock climbing, one must climb a vertical wall using various handholds. These holds require different kinds of grips, including an open grip, a pocket grip, a sideways pull, and a crimp grip. For each grip, the climber must position his or her hands and fingers differently. If you use the wrong grip on a handhold, you\u2019re more likely to fall. Using standard psychological techniques, the researchers examined what was going on in the brains of climbers when they surveyed the various holds. They first noted that, unlike novices, experienced climbers automatically identified each hold according to the type of grip it required. In their mental representations of the various holds, all of the holds that required a crimp grip, for instance, were put together in one group and were distinguished from the holds that required, say, a pocket grip, which were themselves mentally put into a separate group. This grouping was done unconsciously, just as you can look at a poodle and Great Dane and know instantly they are both members of the same category without ever actually saying to yourself, \u201cThose are both dogs.\u201d In other words, experienced climbers had developed mental representations of holds that allowed them to know without conscious thought what sort of grip was required for each hold they saw. Furthermore, the researchers found that when experienced climbers saw a particular hold, their brains sent a signal to their hands preparing them to form the corresponding grip\u2014again, without conscious thought. The inexperienced climbers had to consciously figure out the appropriate grip for each hold. The ability of experienced climbers to automatically analyze holds using a mental representation allows them to climb more quickly and with less chance of falling. Again, better mental representations lead to better performance. MAKING SENSE OF INFORMATION For the experts we just described, the key benefit of mental representations lies in how they help us deal with information: understanding and interpreting it, holding it in memory, organizing it, analyzing it, and making decisions with it. The same is true for all experts\u2014and most of us are experts at something, whether we realize it or not. For instance, most everyone reading this right now is an \u201cexpert\u201d in reading, and to get to that level you had to develop certain mental representations. It began with learning the correspondence between letters and sounds. At that point reading was a matter of laboriously sounding out each word, letter by letter. With practice, you began to recognize entire words by themselves. C-A-T became simply cat, thanks to a mental representation that encoded the pattern of the letters in that word and associated that pattern with both the sound of the word and the idea of a small, furry animal that meows and often doesn\u2019t get along well with dogs. Along with the mental representations for the words, you developed a variety of other representations that are essential in reading. You learned how to recognize the beginning and ending of a sentence so that you could break up the strings of words into chunks that had individual meaning, and you learned that certain things that looked like they signaled the end of a sentence\u2014Mr., Ms., Dr., and so on\u2014usually did not. You internalized various patterns that allow you to infer the meanings of words you have never seen before and to use context to make sense of things where a word is misspelled or misused or left out altogether. And now when you read, you do all of this unconsciously, the mental representations churning away under the surface, unnoticed but essential. While almost all of you reading this are experts in reading, in the sense that you are fully capable of recognizing the marks on the page as corresponding to words and sentences in your language, some of you will be more expert than others in the task of understanding and assimilating the information contained in this book. And, again, this is related to how well your mental representations allow you to overcome the limitations of short-term memory and retain what you are reading. To see why, consider what happens when you test a group of subjects by having them read a newspaper article on something a bit specialized\u2014say, a football or baseball game\u2014and then quiz them to see how much of it they remember. You might guess that the results would depend mainly on the subjects\u2019 general verbal ability (which is closely related to IQ), but you\u2019d be wrong. Studies have shown that the key factor determining a person\u2019s comprehension of a story about a football or baseball game is how much that person already understands about the sport. The reason is straightforward: If you don\u2019t know much about the sport, then all of the details you read are essentially a bunch of unrelated facts, and remembering them is not much easier than remembering a list of random words. But if you understand the sport, you\u2019ve already established a mental structure for making sense of it, organized the information, and combined it with all the other relevant information you\u2019ve already assimilated. The new information becomes part of an ongoing story, and as such it moves quickly and easily into your long-term memory, allowing you to remember far more of the information in an article than you could if you were unfamiliar with the game it describes. The more you study a subject, the more detailed your mental representations of it become, and the better you get at assimilating new information. Thus a chess expert can look at a series of moves in chess notation that are gibberish to most people\u20141. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 . . .\u2014and follow and understand an entire game. Similarly, an expert musician can look at a musical score for a new composition and know what it will sound like before ever playing it. And if you are a reader who is already familiar with the concept of deliberate practice or with the broader area of the psychology of learning, you will likely find it easier than other readers to assimilate the information in this book. Either way, reading this book and thinking about the topics I\u2019m discussing will help you create new mental representations, which will in turn make it easier for you to read and learn more about this subject in the future. FINDING AN ANSWER Every so often the New York Times publishes a column called \u201cThink Like a Doctor\u201d by Lisa Sanders, a doctor and author. Each column poses a medical mystery, a real case that initially puzzled the clinicians who encountered it\u2014the newspaper version of an episode of House M.D. Sanders gives the readers enough information to solve it themselves\u2014assuming they have all the other tools they need, such as medical knowledge and the ability to reason from symptoms to diagnosis\u2014and then invites answers. In a later column she reveals the correct answer, explains how the original doctors reached that answer, and announces how many readers got it right. These columns always draw hundreds of reader responses\u2014and only a few correct ones. For me the most fascinating thing about the column is not the medical mysteries or their solutions but rather the insights that the column offers into the diagnostic thought process. A doctor making a diagnosis, particularly in a complex case, is given a large number of facts about the patient\u2019s condition and must absorb those facts and then combine them with relevant medical knowledge to come to a conclusion. This doctor must do at least three different things: assimilate facts about the patient, recall relevant medical knowledge, and use the facts and medical knowledge to identify possible diagnoses and choose the right one. For all of these activities, a more sophisticated mental representation makes the process faster and more efficient\u2014and sometimes makes it possible, period. To see how this works, I\u2019ll borrow one of Sanders\u2019s medical mysteries\u2014one that only a handful of readers solved correctly, out of more than two hundred who sent in answers. A thirty-nine-year-old male police officer came to his doctor complaining of an intense earache\u2014it felt like a knife in his ear\u2014and noting that his right pupil was smaller than his left. He had had the earache once before and had visited an urgent-care center, where he was diagnosed with an infection and given a prescription for antibiotics. When it got better in a couple of days, he thought nothing more about it, but the earache reappeared two months later, and this time the antibiotics did no good. The doctor thought it was probably just a sinus infection, but because of the issue with the pupil, the patient was referred to an eye doctor. That doctor couldn\u2019t make a diagnosis and referred the patient to a specialist. The specialist, a neuro-opthalmologist, immediately recognized the small pupil as a symptom of a particular syndrome but had no idea what might cause that syndrome in an otherwise healthy man\u2014and how it all might be related to the intense ear pain. So he asked a number of questions: Have you felt weakness anywhere? What about numbness or tingling? Have you been lifting weights recently? When the patient replied that he had been lifting weights for several months, the doctor asked one more question: Had he experienced any serious pain in his head or neck after lifting? Yes, he\u2019d had an intense post-workout headache a couple of weeks earlier. The doctor could finally figure out what was wrong. At first, the essential step in solving this mystery might seem to be recognizing what syndrome could cause one pupil to be smaller than the other, but this was actually pretty straightforward: it required having learned about that syndrome at some point and being able to recall its symptoms. It is called \u201cHorner\u2019s syndrome,\u201d and it is caused by damage to a nerve that runs behind the eye. The damage hurts the eye\u2019s ability to dilate and often limits the movement of the eyelid covering that eye\u2014and, indeed, when the specialist looked closely, he could see that that eyelid was not opening fully. Several readers identified Horner\u2019s syndrome correctly but were stymied by how that might be connected to the ear pain. In this particular sort of challenge\u2014piecing together a number of clues\u2014the mental representations of expert doctors come to the fore. A doctor diagnosing a patient with a complex set of symptoms must take in a great deal of information without knowing ahead of time which is most relevant and which might be red herrings. It\u2019s impossible to assimilate all that information as random facts\u2014the limitations of short-term memory will not allow it\u2014so it must be understood against the background of the relevant medical knowledge. But what is relevant? Before a diagnosis is made, it is difficult to know what the various bits of clinical information might imply and what sorts of medical conditions they might be related to. Medical students, whose mental representations of diagnostic medicine are still rudimentary, tend to associate symptoms with the particular medical conditions that they\u2019re familiar with and jump quickly to conclusions. They fail to generate multiple options. Even many less experienced doctors do the same thing. Thus, when the police officer went to the urgent-care clinic complaining of an earache, the doctor there assumed the problem was an infection of some sort\u2014which would have been the correct answer in most cases\u2014and didn\u2019t worry about the seemingly irrelevant fact that one of the patient\u2019s pupils was acting up. Unlike medical students, expert diagnosticians have built sophisticated mental representations that let them consider a number of different facts at once, even facts that at first might not seem germane. This is a major advantage of highly developed mental representations: you can assimilate and consider a great deal more information at once. Research on expert diagnosticians has found that they tend to see symptoms and other relevant data not as isolated bits of information but as pieces of larger patterns\u2014in much the same way that grandmasters see patterns among chess pieces rather than a random assortment of pieces. And just as chess masters\u2019 representations allow them to quickly generate a number of possible moves and then zero in on the best one, experienced diagnosticians come up with a number of possible diagnoses and then analyze the various alternatives to select the most likely one. Of course, the doctor may ultimately decide that none of the options work, but the process of reasoning through each of them may well have led to still other possibilities. This ability to generate a number of likely diagnoses and carefully reason through them distinguishes expert diagnosticians from the rest. The solution to the medical mystery described in the New York Times required precisely that sort of approach: first come up with possible explanations for why a patient should have both Horner\u2019s syndrome and a knifelike pain in the ear, and then analyze each possibility to find the right answer. Stroke was one possibility, but the patient had nothing in his background that indicated he might have had a stroke. Shingles could also produce the patient\u2019s two symptoms, but he had none of the usual signs of shingles such as blisters or a rash. A third possibility was a tear in the wall of the carotid artery, which runs right alongside the nerve affected in Horner\u2019s and also passes near the ear. A slight tear in the artery can allow blood to leak through the inner walls of the artery, causing a bulge in its outer wall, which can press on the nerve to the face and, in rare cases, also press on a nerve to the ear. With this in mind, the specialist asked the patient questions about lifting weights and headaches. It is known that weightlifting can sometimes tear the carotid artery, and such a tear would normally be associated with some sort of headache or neck pain. When the patient answered yes, the specialist decided that a tear in the carotid artery was the most likely diagnosis. An MRI scan verified that diagnosis, and the patient was put on blood thinners to prevent the formation of a blood clot and was told to avoid any sort of exertion for the several months that it would take the blood vessel to heal. The key to the successful diagnosis wasn\u2019t merely having the necessary medical knowledge, but having that knowledge organized and accessible in a way that allowed the doctor to come up with possible diagnoses and to zero in on the most likely. The superior organization of information is a theme that appears over and over again in the study of expert performers. This is true even for something as mundane as insurance sales. A recent study examined knowledge about multiline insurance (life, home, auto, and commercial) in 150 agents. Not surprisingly, the highly successful agents\u2014as determined by their sales volumes\u2014knew more about the various insurance products than the less successful agents. But more to the point, researchers found that the highly successful agents had much more complex and integrated \u201cknowledge structures\u201d\u2014what we\u2019re calling mental representations\u2014than the less successful agents. In particular, the better agents had much more highly developed \u201cif . . . then\u201d structures: if these things are true about a client, then say this or do that. Because their insurance knowledge was better organized, the best agents could figure out what to do more quickly and more accurately in any given situation, and this made them much more effective agents. PLANNING Before experienced rock climbers begin a climb, they will look over the entire wall and visualize the path they are going to take, seeing themselves moving from hold to hold. This ability to create a detailed mental representation of a climb before embarking on it is something that only comes with experience. More generally, mental representations can be used to plan a wide variety of areas, and the better the representation, the more effective the planning. Surgeons, for example, will often visualize an entire surgery before making the first incision. They use MRIs, CT scans, and other images to take a look inside the patient and identify potential trouble spots, then they devise a plan of attack. Developing such mental representations of a surgery is one of the most challenging\u2014and most important\u2014things that a surgeon can do, and more experienced surgeons generally create more sophisticated and more effective representations of these procedures. The representations not only guide the surgery, but they also serve to provide a warning when something unexpected and potentially dangerous happens in the surgery. When an actual surgery diverges from the surgeon\u2019s mental representation, he or she knows to slow down, rethink the options, and, if necessary, formulate a new plan in response to the new information. Relatively few of us climb rocks or perform surgeries, but almost everyone writes, and the process of writing offers us an excellent example of how mental representations can be used in planning. I myself have become quite familiar with this arena over the past couple of years as I\u2019ve worked on Peak, and many of the people reading this book will have done some writing lately as well, whether it has been a personal letter or a business memo, a blog post or a book. There has been quite a bit of research into the representations people use when writing, and the research has demonstrated a profound difference between the methods used by expert writers and those used by novices. Consider, for example, the answer that a sixth-grader offered when asked about the strategy he used in writing an essay: I have a whole bunch of ideas and write down till my supply of ideas is exhausted. Then I might try to think of more ideas up to the point where you can\u2019t get any more ideas that are worth putting down on paper and then I would end it. This approach is actually pretty typical, not just for sixth-graders but for many people who don\u2019t write for a living. The representation of the writing is simple and direct: there\u2019s a topic and there are various thoughts that the writer has on the topic, often loosely organized by relevance or importance, but sometimes by category or some other pattern. A slightly more sophisticated representation might include some sort of introduction at the beginning and a conclusion or summary at the end, but that\u2019s about it. This approach to writing has been called \u201cknowledge telling\u201d because it is little more than telling the reader whatever comes into your head. Expert writers do it very differently. Consider how my coauthor and I put this book together. First we had to figure out what we wanted the book to do. What did we want readers to learn about expertise? What concepts and ideas were important to introduce? How should a reader\u2019s ideas about training and potential be changed by reading this book? Answering questions like these gave us our first rough mental representation of the book\u2014our goals for it, what we wanted it to accomplish. Of course, as we worked more and more on the book, that initial image evolved, but it was a start. Next we started sketching out how we would accomplish our goals for the book. What general topics did we need to cover? Obviously we needed to explain what deliberate practice is. How would we do that? Well, first we would need to explain how people normally practice and the limitations of that approach, and then we would discuss purposeful practice, and so on. At that point we were envisioning various approaches we could use to reach our goals for the book and weighing them, seeing which options seemed best. As we made our choices, we gradually honed our mental representation of the book until we had something that seemed to meet all of our goals. The simplest way to imagine our mental representation at this stage is to think back to the old outlining technique you learned back in junior high English class. We prepared an outline of chapters, each focused on a particular topic and covering various aspects of that topic. But the representation of the book that we had created was far richer and more complex than a simple outline. We knew, for instance, why each piece was there and what we wanted to accomplish with it. And we had a clear idea of the book\u2019s structure and logic\u2014why one topic followed another\u2014and the interconnections among the various pieces. We found that this process also forced us to think carefully about how we conceptualized deliberate practice ourselves. We started off with what seemed to be a clear idea of deliberate practice and how to explain it, but as we tried to describe it briefly in a nontechnical way, sometimes we found that it just wasn\u2019t working as well as we would have liked. That would lead us to rethink the best way to explain a concept or to make a point. For example, when we presented our initial proposal to our agent, Elyse Cheney, she and her colleagues had trouble understanding deliberate practice clearly. In particular, they didn\u2019t get what separates deliberate practice from other forms of practice, other than that it is more effective. This was not their fault, but an indication that we hadn\u2019t made our explanation as readily intelligible as we\u2019d thought. That forced us to rethink how we were presenting deliberate practice\u2014in essence, to come up with a new and better mental representation of how we thought about it and how we wanted others to think about it. It soon occurred to us that the role of mental representations held the key to how we wanted to present deliberate practice. Initially, we had seen mental representations as being just one aspect of deliberate practice among many that we would present to the reader, but now we began to see them as a central feature\u2014perhaps the central feature\u2014of the book. The main purpose of deliberate practice is to develop effective mental representations, and, as we will discuss shortly, mental representations in turn play a key role in deliberate practice. The key change that occurs in our adaptable brains in response to deliberate practice is the development of better mental representations, which in turn open up new possibilities for improved performance. In short, we came to see our explanation of mental representations as the keystone of the book, without which the rest of the book could not stand. There was a steady interplay between the writing of the book and our conceptualization of the topic, and as we looked for ways to make our messages clearer to the reader, we would come up with new ways to think about deliberate practice ourselves. Researchers refer to this sort of writing as \u201cknowledge transforming,\u201d as opposed to \u201cknowledge telling,\u201d because the process of writing changes and adds to the knowledge that the writer had when starting out. This is an example of one way in which expert performers use mental representations to improve their performance: they monitor and evaluate their performance, and, when necessary, they modify their mental representations in order to make them more effective. The more effective the mental representation is, the better the performance will be. We had developed a certain mental representation of the book, but we found out that it had led us to a performance (the explanations in our original proposal) that was not as good as we wished, so we used the feedback we had gotten and modified the representation accordingly. This in turn led us to a much better explanation of deliberate practice. And so it went throughout the writing of the book. Although it was constantly evolving, our mental representation of the book guided us and informed our decisions about our writing. As we went along, we evaluated each piece\u2014in the later stages with the help of our editor, Eamon Dolan\u2014and when we found weaknesses, we tweaked the representation to fix the problem. Obviously the mental representation for a book is much larger and more complex than one for a personal letter or a blog post, but the general pattern is the same: to write well, develop a mental representation ahead of time to guide your efforts, then monitor and evaluate your efforts and be ready to modify that representation as necessary. MENTAL REPRESENTATIONS IN LEARNING In general, mental representations aren\u2019t just the result of learning a skill; they can also help us learn. Some of the best evidence for this comes from the field of musical performance. Several researchers have examined what differentiates the best musicians from lesser ones, and one of the major differences lies in the quality of the mental representations the best ones create. When practicing a new piece, beginning and intermediate musicians generally lack a good, clear idea of how the music should sound, while advanced musicians have a very detailed mental representation of the music they use to guide their practice and, ultimately, their performance of a piece. In particular, they use their mental representations to provide their own feedback so that they know how close they are to getting the piece right and what they need to do differently to improve. The beginners and intermediate students may have crude representations of the music that allow them to tell, for instance, when they hit a wrong note, but they must rely on feedback from their teachers to identify the more subtle mistakes and weaknesses. Even among beginning music students, it seems that differences in the quality of how the music is represented make a difference in how effective practice can be. About fifteen years ago two Australian psychologists, Gary McPherson and James Renwick, studied a number of children between the ages of seven and nine who were learning to play various instruments: the flute, the trumpet, the cornet, the clarinet, and the saxophone. Part of the study was to videotape the children as they practiced at home and then to analyze the practice sessions to understand what the children did to make their practice more or less effective. In particular, the researchers counted the number of mistakes a student made in practicing a piece the first time and the second time and used the improvement from the first time to the second as a measurement of how effectively the student was practicing. They found a wide variation in the amount of improvement. Of all the students they studied, a female cornet player in her first year of learning the instrument made the most mistakes: 11 per minute, on average, on the first times playing pieces during practice sessions. On the second time through, she was still making the same mistakes 70 percent of the time\u2014noticing and correcting only 3 out of every 10 mistakes. By contrast, the best first-year player, a boy who was learning the saxophone, made only 1.4 mistakes per minute on his first times through. And on the second times through, he was making the same mistakes only 20 percent of the time\u2014correcting 8 out of every 10 mistakes. The difference in the percentage of corrections is particularly striking because the saxophone player was already making many fewer mistakes, so he had much less room for improvement. All of the students had good attitudes and were motivated to improve, so McPherson and Renwick concluded that the differences among the students most likely lay, in large part, in how well the students were able to detect their mistakes\u2014that is, how effective their mental representations of the musical pieces were. The saxophone player had a clear mental representation of the piece that allowed him to recognize most of his mistakes, remember them the next time, and correct them. The cornet player, on the other hand, didn\u2019t seem to have such a well-developed mental representation of what she was playing. The difference between the two was not in desire or effort, the researchers said. The cornet player just didn\u2019t have the same tools with which to improve as the saxophone player did. McPherson and Renwick didn\u2019t try to understand the precise nature of the mental representations, but other research indicates that the representations could have taken several forms. One would be an aural representation\u2014a clear idea of what a piece should sound like. Musicians at every level use these to guide their practice and their play, and better musicians have far more detailed representations, which include not just the pitch and the length of the notes to be played, but their volume, rise and fall, intonation, vibrato, tremolo, and harmonic relationship with other notes, including notes played on other instruments by other musicians. Good musicians not only recognize these various qualities of musical sound but know how to produce them on their instruments\u2014an understanding that requires its own sort of mental representation, which is in turn quite closely tied to the mental representations of the sounds themselves. The students McPherson and Renwick studied probably also had developed, to one degree or another, mental representations that connected notes written on a musical score with the fingering necessary to play those notes. Thus, if the saxophonist accidentally placed his fingers in the wrong position for a note, he would probably notice it not only because his horn produced the wrong sound but also because his fingering felt \u201coff\u201d\u2014that is, it didn\u2019t match his mental representation of where his fingers should be placed. While the study by McPherson and Renwick has the advantage of being very personal\u2014we almost feel as though we know the cornet player and the saxophonist when we\u2019re done\u2014it has the disadvantage of having observed only a few musicians in one school. Fortunately, its results are backed up by a British study of more than three thousand music students, ranging from beginners to experts ready to enter a university-level conservatory. The researchers found, among other things, that the more accomplished music students were better able to determine when they\u2019d made mistakes and better able to identify difficult sections they needed to focus their efforts on. This implies that the students had more highly developed mental representations of the music they were playing and of their own performances, which allowed them to monitor their practice and spot mistakes. Furthermore, the more advanced music students also had more effective practice techniques. The implication is that they were using their mental representations not only to spot mistakes but also to match appropriate practice techniques with the types of difficulties they were having with the music. In any area, not just musical performance, the relationship between skill and mental representations is a virtuous circle: the more skilled you become, the better your mental representations are, and the better your mental representations are, the more effectively you can practice to hone your skill. We can see a more detailed depiction of how an expert uses mental representations through a long-term collaboration between Roger Chaffin, a psychologist at the University of Connecticut, and Gabriela Imreh, an internationally known pianist based in New Jersey. For years they have been working together to understand what goes through Imreh\u2019s head as she studies, practices, and performs a piece of music. Much of Chaffin\u2019s work with Imreh is reminiscent of how I monitored Steve Faloon\u2019s development of mental representations for memorizing strings of digits. He observes her as she is learning a new piece of music and has her voice her thought processes as she determines how she will play it. He also videotapes these practice sessions so that he has additional clues as to how Imreh is approaching her task. In one series of sessions, Chaffin followed Imreh as she spent more than thirty hours practicing the third movement of the Italian Concerto of Johann Sebastian Bach, which she was scheduled to play for the first time. The first thing Imreh did when she sight-read the piece was to develop what he called an \u201cartistic image\u201d\u2014a representation of what the piece should sound like when she performed it. Now, Imreh was not coming to this piece cold\u2014she\u2019d heard it many times\u2014but the fact that she was able to create this mental image of the piece simply by reading the score indicates just how highly developed her mental representations of the piano are. Where most of us would see musical symbols on a page, she heard the music in her head. Much of what Imreh did from that point on was figuring out how to perform the piece so that it matched her artistic image. She began by going through the entire piece and deciding exactly what fingering she would use. Where possible, she would use the standard fingering that pianists learn for particular series of notes, but there were places that required departing from the standard because she wanted that particular passage to sound a certain way. She would try out different options, decide on one, and note it on the score. She also identified different moments in the composition that Chaffin called \u201cexpressive turning points\u201d\u2014for instance, a point where her playing would turn from light and lively to more measured and serious. Later she would pick out cues in the music\u2014short passages before a turning point or a technically difficult passage that, when she came to them, would serve as prompts to get ready for what was coming. She also picked out various places where she would add nuanced interpretations of the music. By putting all of these different elements into an overall map of the piece, Imreh managed to do justice to both the forest and the trees. She formed an image of what the whole piece should sound like, while also giving herself clear images of the details she needed to pay close attention to as she was playing. Her mental representation combined what she thought the music was supposed to sound like with what Imreh had figured out about how to make it sound that way. Although other pianists\u2019 mental representations would likely differ from Imreh\u2019s in the specifics, their overall approaches are likely to be very similar. Her mental representation also allowed Imreh to deal with a fundamental dilemma facing any classical pianist learning to play a piece. It is crucial that the musician practice and memorize the piece in such a way that the performance can be done almost automatically, with the fingers of each hand playing the proper notes with little or no conscious direction from the pianist; in this way the piece can be performed flawlessly on stage in front of an audience even if the pianist is nervous or excited. On the other hand, the pianist must have a certain amount of spontaneity in order to connect and communicate with the audience. Imreh did this by using her mental map of the piece. She would play much of the piece just as she always practiced it, with her fingers going through well-rehearsed motions, but she always knew exactly where she was in the piece because she\u2019d identified various points that served as landmarks. Some of these were performance landmarks that would signal to Imreh that, for example, a change in fingering was approaching, while others were what Chaffin called \u201cexpressive landmarks.\u201d These indicated places where she could vary her playing to capture a particular emotion, depending on how she felt and how the audience was responding. That allowed her to maintain spontaneity within the demanding constraints of performing a complicated piece before a live audience. PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES ARE MENTAL TOO As we\u2019ve just seen from several studies, musicians rely on mental representations to improve both the physical and cognitive aspects of their specialties. And mental representations are essential to activities we see as almost purely physical. Indeed, any expert in any field can be rightly seen as a high-achieving intellectual where that field is concerned. This applies to pretty much any activity in which the positioning and movement of a person\u2019s body is evaluated for artistic expression by human judges. Think of gymnastics, diving, figure skating, or dancing. Performers in these areas must develop clear mental representations of how their bodies are supposed to move to generate the artistic appearance of their performance routines. But even in areas where artistic form is not explicitly judged, it is still important to train the body to move in particularly efficient ways. Swimmers learn to perform their strokes in ways that maximize thrust and minimize drag. Runners learn to stride in ways that maximize speed and endurance while conserving energy. Pole-vaulters, tennis players, martial artists, golfers, hitters in baseball, three-point shooters in basketball, weightlifters, skeet shooters, and downhill skiers\u2014for all of these athletes proper form is key to good performance, and the performers with the best mental representations will have an advantage over the rest. In these areas too, the virtuous circle rules: honing the skill improves mental representation, and mental representation helps hone the skill. There is a bit of a chicken-and-egg component to this. Take figure skating: it\u2019s hard to have a clear mental representation of what a double axel feels like until you\u2019ve done it, and, likewise, it is difficult to do a clean double axel without a good mental representation of one. That sounds paradoxical, but it isn\u2019t really. You work up to a double axel bit by bit, assembling the mental representations as you go. It\u2019s like a staircase that you climb as you build it. Each step of your ascent puts you in a position to build the next step. Then you build that step, and you\u2019re in a position to build the next one. And so on. Your existing mental representations guide your performance and allow you to both monitor and judge that performance. As you push yourself to do something new\u2014to develop a new skill or sharpen an old one\u2014you are also expanding and sharpening your mental representations, which will in turn make it possible for you to do more than you could before.","title":"Chap 3"},{"location":"Chi%20Ph%C3%AD%20Ch%C3%ACm/","text":"Chi Ph\u00ed Ch\u00ecm \u00b6 metadata created: Oct 25, 2020 9:46 PM tags: #created/2020/Oct/25, previous note: Notes \u00b6 Trong kinh t\u1ebf h\u1ecdc, c\u00e1c chi ph\u00ed kh\u00f4ng thu l\u1ea1i \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c l\u00e0 chi ph\u00ed ch\u00ecm.

Mentioned elsewhere by Mihaly et al are the additional negative factors of distractions ( Attention ) and low self-esteem ( Enthusiasm ). Related: [[Flow, Insights, and Acting cannot be forced]] Let's look at those three conditions of flow again, this time, relating them to major factors controlling them and giving you the levers needed to master them. Clear proximal goals \u2014 Right now, what am I doing and what do I need to do? This is all about Direction . Are you clear on your direction? It's worth noting that even if this activity isn't part of your big goals in life, you can still be in flow as long as you are clear on what you're doing in the moment.

This is one of my [[Strong opinions, weakly held]].","title":"Evergreen notes are things or opinions about things"},{"location":"C%C3%A1c%20lo%E1%BA%A1i%20th%E1%BB%B1c%20ph%E1%BA%A9m%20gi%C3%BAp%20n%C3%A3o%20s%E1%BA%A3n%20sinh%20nhi%E1%BB%81u%20noron%20h%C6%A1n/","text":"C\u00e1c lo\u1ea1i th\u1ef1c ph\u1ea9m gi\u00fap n\u00e3o s\u1ea3n sinh nhi\u1ec1u noron h\u01a1n \u00b6 Created: August 10, 2021 9:45 AM [@ [tamlyhoctoipham.com]], \u01af\u01a1m gi\u1ed1ng m\u1ed9t n\u01a1ron, vun tr\u1ed3ng m\u1ed9t b\u1ed9 n\u00e3o C\u00e1c lo\u1ea1i th\u1ef1c ph\u1ea9m c\u00f3 ch\u1ee9a ch\u1ea5t flavonoid gi\u00fap n\u00e3o s\u1ea3n sinh nhi\u1ec1u Neuron h\u01a1n nh\u01b0 socola \u0111en.

Advanced \u00b6 Fluentzy: The Fluency Development Course by Prof. Kev Nair. Prof. Kev Nair is a well-known authority and is considered \u201cThe Father of Fluency Development\u201d. It is a set of 20 books. It doesn\u2019t teach grammar. It is for people who already know English quite well and want to speak fluently. I\u2019ll just give some highlights from this course. 1. Foreign speakers learn English the wrong way. We are taught to write English rather than to speak first. 2. There\u2019s a lot of differences between written and spoken English. 3. The right way to learn to speak is in word-groups instead of individual words. 4. The way English is spoken is completely different from the way our languages are spoken. 5. Fluency is achieved only when our ears and tongue are trained in English. We may know English but the tongue has to be taught in English ways. And ears have to stop being hesitant to English sounds. 6. Fluency is achieved only through self-study, without any instructor, without any recordings. Any external means is a hurdle. 7. We should get exposed to spoken English a lot. We should read novels written in loose, conversational style. Newspaper, non-fiction books, magazines, and like should be avoided as they\u2019re written for different purpose and aren\u2019t suitable from fluency perspective. 8. We should avoid bilingual dictionaries and learn to think in English. We should buy at least one Advanced English dictionary and look up words for even simple words. Not any word, but fluency oriented words.","title":"English Roadmap"},{"location":"English%20Roadmap/#beginer","text":"[[Essential English Grammar]] by Raymond Murphy: V\u0103n ph\u1ea1m c\u01a1 b\u1ea3n v\u1eeba \u0111\u1ee7 \u0111\u1ec3 s\u1eed d\u1ee5ng cho ng\u01b0\u1eddi m\u1edbi b\u1eaft \u0111\u1ea7u","title":"Beginer"},{"location":"English%20Roadmap/#intermediate","text":"[[Intermediate English Grammar]] by Raymond Murphy: V\u0103n ph\u1ea1m n\u00e2ng cao h\u01a1n Pronounce: One of the most important things to learn is how to pronounce words in English [[Word Power Made Easy]] by Norman Lewis: - Pronounce - Vocabulary - Trong quy\u1ec3n n\u00e0y c\u00f3 n\u00eau l\u00ean c\u1ea5u tr\u00fac c\u1ee7a t\u1eeb, c\u00e1ch m\u00e0 m\u1ed7i t\u1eeb \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c t\u1ea1o ra, bi\u1ebft \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c c\u00e1c t\u1eeb g\u1ed1c t\u1ea1o ra v\u00f4 s\u1ed1 c\u00e1c t\u1eeb kh\u00e1c.","title":"Intermediate"},{"location":"English%20Roadmap/#advanced","text":"Fluentzy: The Fluency Development Course by Prof. Kev Nair.

Main Factors Governing the Strength of Each \u00b6 Direction \u2014 Level of Clarity; Amount of Directions \u2014 Aside from \"Nature & Nurture\" (which is a philosophical rabbit hole), it's the Level of Clarity and Amount of Directions (i.e. the number of goals one has) that most govern the strength of Direction. Attention \u2014 Distractions in both Frequency and Intensity \u2014 This is most governed by Distractions: the Intensity of Distractions and the Frequency of Distractions. Enthusiasm \u2014 Level of Desire \u2014 This also ties into \"Nature & Nurture\" a bit. It might sound circular, but one's Level of Desire dictates one's Enthusiasm. It's the most intangible. What excites somebody? What inspires them, motivates them, fills them with passion? I'm not sure how to best affect one's Enthusiasm. It's the \"Why\" in the world of \"Goal Setting.\" It's very personal to each person, but some commonalities are usually: to be stimulated and engaged, to feel important, to feel the work is important, to improve one's financial situation. [[Energy]] \u2014 Quality of Sleep, Diet, & Exercise; Quality of Relationships & Community; Quality of Leisure Time \u2014 also Hydration, Sunlight, Nature, Hobbies, etc. How They Impact Each Other \u00b6 If Direction is clear and not diluted, then it's easier to focus one's Attention; Enthusiasm isn't diluted; Energy isn't wasted. If Attention isn't spread too thin amid myriad distractions, then it's easier to stay on target in the ideal Direction; Enthusiasm isn't diluted; Energy isn't wasted. If Enthusiasm is strong, then it's easier to stay committed to one's Direction; it's easier to maintain one's Attention; it's easier to compensate for middling Energy levels. If Energy is cultivated, then your Direction seems possible/doable/easier; You can more easily maintain your Attention; you can get work done even when you're not feeling Enthusiasm (and through the process of doing the work, you can usually create new Enthusiasm). If you have a [[Poor Diet]], then your Attention is going to suck: you'll be more easily distracted; so you'll spend time in other Directions; and thus you'll dilute and dissipate your Enthusiasm. This one is a huge component that you can control. You can replace \"Poor Diet\" with \"Lack of Sleep\" and you'll get similar results.","title":"Four Factors of Flow"},{"location":"Four%20Factors%20of%20Flow/#four-factors-of-flow","text":"These are the four factors that govern flow.

Every note in a note library is a note. They come in two basic varieties: A [[What is a note|note]] with mostly words A note with mostly links to other notes Let's agree for the moment that a \"note-with-mostly-words\" is less complex than a \"note-with-mostly-links\". A note with mostly links can therefore be considered a higher-order note . It is still a note, but all those links help to provide some sort of structure that adds complexity to the note itself. Let's explore the wonderful world of higher-order notes. What can we call higher-order notes? \u00b6 Adding a new word to our vocabulary opens up new ways of thinking and expressing. Limiting our vocabulary\u2014like Big Brother does in George Orwell's 1984\u2014is a sinister way to limit our thinking. With that in mind, instead of trying to limit what we can higher-order notes, we should explore the many flavors of them. Here's a non-exhaustive list of things we can call higher-order notes. Link Note - A note with a bunch of links. Hub Note - A navigational note, like an airport hub (a Luhmann term). Index Note - A note that references other notes (sometimes but not always alphabetical). Workbench - A brainstorm-y note with a links hastily assembled. Outline Note - A note for the early-stage outlining of content. Structure Note - A term that describes what it does: structures stuff. Structure Zettel - A term from zettelkasten.de - Usually shown as a linear Table of Contents, often with annotations. Table of Contents - A finalized structure that references material MOC (Map of Content) - A flexible higher-order note that serves all the above purposes of gathering, outlining, structuring, and navigating. In addition, it is an active thinking tool that allows for the reshaping, connecting, and building of ideas. Here's what else an MOC can do: MOCs can structure links in completely countless and non-linear ways. MOCs can be a combo of links and tags and text and embeds and anything you can think of. MOCs can be linked to other MOCs (Emergence Level 4), which eventually link to a Home note (Emergence Level 5). And most valuable, [[MOCs concentrate & accelerate idea interaction]].

[[2021-03-02]] Preface \u00b6 I'm going to focus as little as possible on the technical aspects of workflows. They are the most fragile and least evergreen, and yet too many people spend too many days trying to construct the most perfect workflow, which has several dependencies, and the second one of those dependencies goes out of date, the whole workflow crumbles. Don't forget the big questions \u00b6 What are your use cases again? Your goals? What are your biggest sticking points? Are they really? What are my workflow rules \u00b6 Separate the noise from the signal (see: [[Signal to Noise Ratio]]). Remember, just because you can capture everything, doesn't mean you should. Strictly limit commenting and organizing in the noise. Highlighting is okay. For research papers as PDFs, commenting is okay too. Use a system of filters to add friction to curate the noise. Practice [[Idea Emergence]] and don't create unearned notes. Try to minimize note-taking so I can maximize note-making. What is my main workflow philosophy \u00b6 Practice \"radical idea emergence\". Don't save that much. With the stuff you do save, don't schedule a time to process it. If it's really important it can't help but reveal its importance over time (from the nothingness, it enters the \"somethingness\"). Then create a new note and develop it. (There are exceptions, like when it's helpful to assemble a pre-made map.) Where am I encountering new things? \u00b6 Web articles; Youtube videos; Podcasts People online; People in real life Books; Movies Research papers Notions Internal thoughts How am I practicing Idea Emergence as I encounter new things? \u00b6 How am I reducing the amount of information I encounter? Does everything have free reign to assault your senses at all times? How am I filtering the quality of the information I encounter? How are you vetting the ideas you come across? How can you raise the standards on your vetting of information? What steps do random bits of information go through before they enter my note-making space? Where is there good friction in this part of my system? My common workflows \u00b6 Processing from the web \u00b6 Prompts : Where am I encountering information? What do I want to do with it? What am I using to save stuff? Bookmarks, Pocket, Drafts What am I not using but could? Evernote, Zotero, DevonThink, Are.na How does the workflow work? Find something interesting, save it to Pocket. Maybe remember to check Pocket at some point. What would you like to change in the future? I'd like to ditch Pocket and get DevonThink rolling. That way I can save documents in an offline format that is easier to organize, use, and future-proof. But this'll take some time and I'm in no rush. Processing a book (and other big things) \u00b6 Prompts : Why am I reading it? If it's mostly for enjoyment, maybe I shouldn't process it (other than to mark something here or there). How much time do I want to spend on this book? Do I want to skim it or devour it? Assuming it's a book I've identified as high-value\u2014and it's a book I actually want to process (instead of just enjoy), then do the following: - Create a new note using [[Template for Book]]. - From the web, copy and paste the table of contents. It's a pre-made, pre-vetted map. Use it as a lattice for quotes and notes. Processing a research paper PDF \u00b6 Prompts : *Why am I reading it? What do I want to do with it? Save the PDF in Zotero. Make highlights in the PDF. Use zotfile to extract highlights. Use mdnotes to extract highlights as markdown (with working links). Only do this when needed. Processing a movie \u00b6 Prompts : *What resonated with me? Processing a notion \u00b6 Prompts : *What resonated with me? How am I adding friction to this notions I encounter?

Maybe, or until you're reminded of it, then maybe it's worth pushing into my note-making space Processing from the inside-out \u00b6 Prompt : Maybe I should just type it out?? Have I considered a daily note? ...an unstructured place to throw my thoughts and words, where I can link out to new notes?
